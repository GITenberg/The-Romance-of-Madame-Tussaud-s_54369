<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The earliest information we have concerning
Madame Tussaud is that she was born in Switzerland
on the 7th of December, 1760, and was the only
child of Joseph and Marie Grosholtz. Her mother
was the daughter of a Swiss clergyman.</p>

<p>She married on the 20th of October, 1795, François
Tussaud, who, it appears, was her junior by seven
years. We are able to trace his family back as far
as 1630, when his great-great-grandfather, one Denis
Tusseaud&mdash;for that is how he spelt his name&mdash;was
born.</p>

<p>There is documentary evidence that Denis was
brought from Burgy to Mâcon in 1631, his family
also coming from Burzy, close by, in 1658.</p>

<p>His descendants lived at Mâcon for more than a
century, their occupation being generally that of workers
in metal.</p>

<p>The great-grandfather of François was Henry Tusseaud
(1684-1717), and his grandfather’s name was
Claude (1716-1767).</p>

<p>François’ father (1744-1786) was the first of the
family to adopt the present spelling of the name, although
we find that various members of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
used the forms Tussot, Tusseau, Tuissiaud, Tussiaut,
Tusseaut, Tussiau, or Thusseaud.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud’s marriage does not appear to have
been a happy one, for we learn that in 1800&mdash;two years
before she came to England&mdash;she separated from her
husband, of whom we hear nothing further, although
he is known to have been living in Paris in the lifetime
of his grandsons.</p>

<p>The foundress of the famous Exhibition had two
sons, Joseph and Francis. Francis (1800-1873) had
several sons, the eldest of whom, Joseph Randall
(1831-1892), who was a student and exhibitor at the
Royal Academy, was the father of the author of this
book.</p>

<p>Mr. John Theodore Tussaud was born in Kensington
on the 2nd of May, 1858, and at the age of six
was sent to St. Charles’s College, London, where he
came under the influence of Cardinal Manning, who
took a keen personal interest in his welfare.</p>

<p>Some six years later he was transferred to Ramsgate,
where he benefited by the training he received
from the Benedictine monks at St. Augustine’s.</p>

<p>In the year 1889 he married Ruth Helena, daughter
of Thomas Grew. There are seven sons and three
daughters of the marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Tussaud, like his father, has exhibited at the
Royal Academy. His occasional contributions to
literature have been welcomed by thoughtful readers,
and he is a recognised authority on historical matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
relating to the French Revolution and the First
Empire.</p>

<p>Seventeen great-grandsons of Madame Tussaud took
an active part in the war, all, without exception, serving
in the British Army. Two were killed and most
of the others wounded.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<br />
<span class="smcap">By Hilaire Belloc</span></h2>

<p>This is a fascinating book and its fascination consists
in two things attaching to its subject: first
that the famous collection of modelled portraits which
has become a sort of national institution in England
under the name of “Madame Tussaud’s” has its roots
in the greatest period of modern history, the French
Revolution; second, in that the complete and growing
record has passed through so many changes and has
yet survived.</p>

<p>Even though the famous collection had dealt with
nothing more than the main figures of the Revolution
and of the great wars that followed it, it would have
been a possession of permanent and lasting historical
value. I am not sure that if it had so remained,
stopped short at the effigies of those now long dead, it
would not now receive a greater respect. It might well
in that case have become something recognised as a national
possession, protected and preserved by the national
government. For the prolongation of the record
right on into our own time, while it very greatly increases
the real value of the collection as a piece of
historical evidence, yet deprives it of that illusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which men cannot avoid where history is concerned:
the illusion that things thoroughly passed are in some
way greater and of more consequence than contemporary
things.</p>

<p>This continuity of the great collection&mdash;so long as
it is maintained with judgment in selection and without
too much yielding to momentary fame is none
the less a thing to be very thankful for. Already those
of us who, like the present writer, are well on into
middle age, can judge how the younger generation is
beginning to regard as historical these simulacra, which,
when they were first modelled, seemed in our own
youth insignificant because they were contemporary.
To our children (who are now grown and are young
men and women), Disraeli, Gladstone, Bismarck&mdash;all
the group that were old but living men in the eighties
(Disraeli died at the beginning of them, Bismarck
long after their close)&mdash;are what to us were Louis-Philippe,
Garibaldi, Palmerston, and the process properly
continued will be invaluable. We have already
more than 130 years of record. There is no reason why
it should not extend to the two centuries.</p>

<p>It often happens that a thing of great value to history,
a piece of evidence which we now find invaluable,
has come to us by an accident, the motive of its creation
not historical at all nor really connected with record.
Indeed of the bulk of historical evidence which
we use to-day for the reconstruction of the past only
a small proportion&mdash;official documents&mdash;are of the nature
of deliberate records. And that proportion of
evidence is on the whole the worst as material, for official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
documents always have a motive underlying them,
and they never give one a vivid picture. The great
bulk of the material with which we used to build up
the past and make it live again for ourselves is accidental.
And so it is with this great collection.</p>

<p>The motive at first was merely that of a waxwork
show. The remarkable woman who created the collection
did so as a matter of business. The exhibits were
intended to satisfy no more than contemporary curiosity.
But they have become a piece of historical evidence
which increases in value with every year. Whatever
you may read (and the accounts are always contradictory)
of some man prominent in the past, whatever
picture or sculpture you may find of him (and
these are often deliberately flattering or in some other
way untrue) the physical impression of him will never
be so full and so exact as in the case of an effigy made
by a contemporary who saw him, watched him, knew
him, <em>and whose whole motive was exactitude in reproduction</em>.</p>

<p>Here there does indeed arise the question of the medium.
You cannot conceive of a better medium than
wax among all the known mediums for production of
effigies of human beings. Yet it is not perfect. And
it is precisely because the likeness is so great, precisely
because the effect is so parallel to that of reality, that
we note the minor details in which illusion is not
achieved. When a man sees a bust of marble he does
not expect to find illusion. The greatest portrait statuary
can never be more than a symbol. But the
wax effigy aims at exact reproduction. To put it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
extreme terms, the ideal of the modeller in wax would
be to reproduce a figure such that one knowing the
original could be deceived and think he had found
again his friend dead or sleeping. When a wax effigy
reproduces a known and real person, especially a person
whom we ourselves have come across, the discrepancy
between reality and its copy is clearer. But there
is this strong evidence in support of the success which
modelling in wax has reached, that where we are dealing
with something unknown, some imaginary person,
it is possible to create, in spite of the immobility of the
figure, an illusion of life. Everyone who has visited
these collections will testify to that. With a person
whom one has seen in the flesh the little details in
which the wax does not tally with the flesh nor immobility
with life, stand out clear. That is especially
the case with those whose complexion is difficult
to imitate. It is also the case in the attachment
of the hair. And I have further noticed that the direction
of the eyes makes a difference, the figure being
more lifelike as a rule when the eyes are cast down or
averted, than when a direct look is imitated. But it
remains true that with an imaginary person when you
are free to suppose that the person had a complexion
of the sort easily imitated in wax, and where you are
further free to presume the pose, you can get as near to
reality in this medium as it is possible for human art
to achieve.</p>

<p>Therein, then, lies the great value of this thing. It
is a witness to history, and as I have said, one increasingly
valuable as time proceeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Still it is with what is chiefly historical in this gallery
of figures and <em>especially with the tradition of the
French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, that we
are most concerned</em>. And the Tussaud collection has
this added interest that it sprung as it were from the
revolutionary time. Its origins lay in that. Its first
fame was due to an emigration from France into England,
and it still remains much the best effort at physical
reconstruction which we have to-day.</p>

<p>The reason is that the lady who founded this institution
was not only herself a contemporary of but an
actor in the principal events of that time. She came
by a series of accidents into direct touch with one personality
after another. She left a record of each. She
was a personal and convincing witness and her work
remains. She is just as much a person of the Revolution
and of the Napoleonic period as any one of those
whom she modelled for our benefit. And that is (let
us remember) of special value <em>in that one is in the
spirit of one’s time</em>.</p>

<p>The artist deliberately reconstructing a bust through
plastic art is always in danger of failing through a
lack of the necessary sympathy between the time in
which he lives and the time in which his subject lived.
The truth of this is expressed very sharply in modern
attempts at reconstructing mediæval sculpture. It
has been done. It is singularly successful, for instance,
in the central porch of Notre Dame in Paris.
But as a rule it fails. The modern man either works
from a modern model, or at any rate with modern
expressions and modern features at the back of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mind. One conspicuous instance occurs to me, the
modern figures upon Lichfield. They are as grievously
out of their supposed time as are the figures of Tennyson’s
“Idylls of the Kings.” The Knights of the
Round Tables of Tennyson’s version are the gentlemen
of pegtopped trousers who were contemporary with
the poet. They have been to public schools and to
universities. They would be horrified at the dropping
of aitches, and they have often attended at services
which were fully choral. They would have called the
inhabitants of the country which they visited “natives.”
That is what Tennyson made of Geraint and Launcelot
and his odious Arthur.</p>

<p>I am afraid one cannot say much more for the
sculptures that I have in my mind. They are dressed
in mediæval armour, but the faces that look out from
the helmets are the faces to be seen in the London clubs
to-day. They are faces devoid of simplicity and
strength. They are not the faces of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>You have the same thing in historical painting, and
that is why historical painting usually looks so ridiculous
in the generation after it was made. We all
know those historical paintings which our grandfathers
bought and which still disfigure the large rooms of
private houses, where you have Richard I of England
charging the Saracens (he, an Angevin!), his face glowing
with the emotions of the football field.</p>

<p>Now this prime difficulty and error in pictorial and
plastic record in the past you can only avoid by the
advantage of contemporary work, and this is where
the great value of this collection comes in. All its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
work is contemporary, and we can to-day, after an interval
of more than a hundred years, weigh the importance
of that point. The revolutionary figures
sometimes look odd to us precisely because their real
aspect has been so vividly preserved. The hand that
modelled Marat was a hand of Marat’s age. It touched
the flesh of the dead man. The eyes that received the
conception reproduced by the hands, gazed upon Marat
himself as he lay back dead.</p>

<p>And here it is convenient to introduce that essential
character in the great collection&mdash;the genius of its originator.</p>

<p>The whole thing, its character, long tradition and
establishment&mdash;is the creation of one remarkable woman,
and of her we ought to have some full biography.
I know of none. She has at least the rare advantage of
having propagated her name justly and the thing she
created is identified with her. It is not often that history
acts with so little irony and with so much generosity.
Her energy was much more remarkable than
that of those very few women who have created and
organised permanent businesses, for it was not only her
judgment and initiative which created the commercial
side of the collection: it was also her own talent and
industry, the work of her own hands, that laid the
foundation of it all. Most of the early portraits were
the direct product of her skill and it is from her that
the continuous tradition of the place descends. Her
sons learnt their art from their mother and carried it
on to the third generation which still continues it. It
was she who took all the critical decisions, she who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
steered the fortunes of the family through the crisis
of the Revolution, who determined to take the collection
over to England, who conceived the idea of making
it a permanent record by adding contemporaries
year after year.</p>

<p>It is not often that one has this intimate admixture
of personality with an institution, and when one gets
it it has an astonishing effect in vivifying the whole.
When an institution is thus the product of a character
at once highly energetic and highly individual,
it is as though a living thing continued on long beyond
the term of a human life. It is, in the strict and
original sense of the word, “inspired.” You get that
quality, of course, in all literature, and in some of the
corporations which remarkable men and women have
founded, but very rarely in a piece of business in an
institution of affairs. Here you get it, and the more
you read of the woman’s life and character the more
you understand the success of her effort and its vitality.</p>

</div>

<p>It was an astonishing life! There lies behind it the
story of her uncle Curtius, a Swiss who left medical
practice in the middle of the 18th century and took to
modelling in wax. It was a taste which had grown
upon him from his habit of modelling parts of the
human body for the purposes of his profession. He
extended it to portraits and at last he abandoned medicine
for his new art. He had firmly established himself
in it and had already been taken up by members
of the French Royal Family who had visited Switzerland,
when under their protection he left for Paris.
And there his sister, Madame Grosholtz, and her child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
then five or six years old, joined him. There she learnt
her uncle’s trade and thence in her twentieth year she
went to live at Versailles as a sort of companion to
Madame Elizabeth, Louis XVI’s sister, a girl about
four years older than herself. She was the close friend
and companion of the princess right up to the moment
of the Revolution. Madame Elizabeth like her brother
had a delight in manual work. With her it took the
form of modelling under the guidance of Marie Grosholtz
and it was these nine years that formed the character
and that remained the liveliest memory throughout
all the very long life that this remarkable woman
was to live.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to discover (I know of no
such document that could tell me, but there must be
some) whether the young companion whom Madame
Elizabeth thus took under her protection, and to whom
she thus gave a unique opportunity for the observation
of contemporary life, was in race German or French.
Berne would seem to be the origin of the family, and
the uncle’s Latin name and the family name of his
brother-in-law point to German origin. All his associations
on the other hand were French, and when he
came to Paris it was hardly as a foreigner. The story
reads as though they were French-speaking on their
arrival. Perhaps in some future edition of the work
this point will be settled. It is one of considerable
moment to our judgment of the art.</p>

<p>It was a moment when the connection between
Switzerland and French society was very close. It was
to Switzerland that Voltaire had retired. It was from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Switzerland that the genius of Rousseau proceeded.
The unfortunate Necker, with his caution and his
avarice, played his great part in the early Revolution
as a Swiss. To Switzerland also he went back when
he had failed&mdash;and there, by the way, in his retirement
we have an amusing picture of him listening to the
daily recital of the news from Paris as the Revolution
proceeded, wagging his head solemnly, and perpetually
saying, “I told you so.”</p>

<p>Madame de Staël, his famous daughter, whom Pitt
so much desired to marry for her money, and whom
Napoleon so hated, was thoroughly Swiss. She shows
it in every line of her writing. She is from the heart
of Geneva in her traditions and ideas.</p>

<p>The family coming thus to Paris were part of a general
movement and even their connection with Versailles
can be paralleled. It would not have taken
much, had things proceeded quietly, for Switzerland
to have fallen into the orbit of the French monarchy
within the next hundred years.</p>

<p>After these nine formative years in the continued
company of Madame Elizabeth, Marie Grosholtz enters
the Revolution, and the connections of the family
with the origins of the great upheaval are close, curious,
and of intense interest. It was, it will be remembered,
the bust of Necker from the collection of Curtius,
then on exhibition, which the mob carried round
at the beginning of the insurrection. The show of figures
already well-known in Paris became the starting-point
for the future collection. It was because the
Revolutionaries from the very beginning of the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
showed so much acquaintance with those effigies
that the continuous stream of further portraits began.
That is why Marie Grosholtz was sent for time after
time to take a death mask, to model a famous living
man, to establish what afterwards became the invaluable
record we still have.</p>

<p>From 1787-89, the preliminary years when she was
already at work, right on to 1802, a matter of 15 years,
the most crowded of all history, the newly developed art
went on actively without interruption. There is not,
I think, in all history a parallel to so astonishing and
lucky a chance. It was almost as though fate had designed
a reporter, or a state portraitist for the benefit
of posterity. You do get the same thing now and
then in the shape of a chronicler who happens to keep
out of the turmoil and mark the detail of his time, but
it is extremely rare and in the case of plastic art, unique.
The nearest parallel to-day&mdash;which may raise a smile
on account of the extreme difference in time and manner&mdash;is
that of Holbein’s portraits of the English
Court. There also you get the living record marvellously
preserved for future times.</p>

<p>It is to our advantage that the character of this
foundress does not diminish in energy with the passage
of time. We see her doing the work of three people
all through the years of her middle age and making
decision after decision upon the fortunes of her house.
And while she was thus conducting with one hand the
financial side of the business, with the other she was
herself still modelling perpetually, and with a third
and quite separate faculty she was creating a school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of her own, as it were, for the continuation of the modelling
after her time. If ever there was the maker of
an important thing it was this woman and if ever
there was an important thing proceeding entirely from
one individual, that thing is the collection which still
remains to us.</p>

<p>There is a sort of parallel which can be drawn between
Madame Tussaud and Madame Campan. Both
of them have seen, and worked at, the Palace of Louis
XVI, under and in connection with his Queen. Both
were much of an age, Madame Campan eight years
senior to Madame Tussaud. Both lived on through
the Revolution and the Empire, the one till 1822, the
other beyond the revolutionary year of 1848. Both had
something of the same strength. Both carried on the
tradition of the old attachment to the Bourbons. Both
have left the legend of a strong personality, the one
through an effect on education in France which was
deeper than has been generally recognised, the other
in a more lasting manner through her plastic work.
In this connection one muses upon what would have
been Madame Tussaud’s fate had she continued her
career in the country where it had begun, and had she
not taken over the collection in its origins to England
at the Peace of Amiens. I think she would have been
a great figure in the France of the Restoration and of
the bourgeois Monarchy. A continuous unbroken link
with all the great years up to 1848 and presenting a
whole gallery of the past for a new generation to witness
would have been something the French and Paris
would have made much of, and a great deal that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lost on the other side of the Channel through lack of
understanding would have been preserved. I mean
that too many of those figures were for those who saw
them in an alien atmosphere jests or shades, whereas
in France they would have been an intimate part of
the great national story.</p>

<p>This removal to England also in some degree affected
the proportion of the collection and in the same
degree diminished its great international value. Not
that figures of international moment had not been included&mdash;the
great figures are all there&mdash;but that Paris
would have been a better general centre for watching
and recording the moving history of the 19th century,
than London. The Musée Grevin in Paris supplemented
the Tussaud collection in England. One imagines
that it would have been better for history as
a whole had one great collection, preferably in Paris,
served for a permanent and continuous chronicle of
what living men had been.</p>

<p>When we come to details of the personalities from
the period before the Revolution to the Peace of Amiens
(the foundation of the whole Exhibition) we are
struck, I think, by the great difference in our appreciation.
Some of the figures are just what we should have
thought these men would have been. Others offend us
or puzzle us by what seems to us discrepancy. But we
must remember that the error is in ourselves and not
in the contemporary record.</p>

<p>Of the great historical figures Voltaire (which is the
first of them) is least specially illuminated by what
I may call “the Tussaud tradition.” And that is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
we already know pretty well all that there is
to know about Voltaire. His story was a simple one,
his genius obvious, not complex, and the time of life
in which Madame Tussaud’s uncle came to sculp him
(to model his face in wax) was just at the very end,
when public fame and his own great pride in himself
had combined to put him into full evidence, even to
the details of his daily life. It was just at the end
of that life, in 1778, that Voltaire sat to Curtius,
Madame Tussaud’s uncle, the original founder of the
whole gallery, and the tutor of his niece in her art.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the little miniature (one
of several) which Curtius made&mdash;it is far more lifelike
than the larger figure&mdash;with the famous Houdon.
Houdon’s is much the greater thing, of course, and
the more living, but though Houdon was the greatest
of portraitists by far, the greatest renderer of the human
face that ever lived, there is something intimate
in the little wax miniature of Curtius which no great
sculptor could have given. For instance, you have
here admitted, as it were, almost photographed, the
domestic insufficient quality of Voltaire’s famous smile.
Houdon could not help making that smile&mdash;or grin&mdash;have
something heroic about it; or at any rate great.
But the Tussaud work undoubtedly shows you the
thing as it actually was; as his servants and his intimates
saw it.</p>

<p>I learn, by the way, from this book (I had not known
it before) that Houdon had himself worked for Curtius&mdash;a
considerably older man&mdash;and the connection
is as curious as it is interesting. It is striking to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a record of the connection in this book, but not astonishing
that it should be absent from others, for
there has been no good comprehensive work on Houdon
written that I can recollect. I am told that there is
some German encyclopædic work or other but no
proper study of the man and his life.</p>

<p>Next after Voltaire we have to note side by side
with the collection a small work of Curtius’s own in
miniature, the very striking profile of the Duke of
Orléans. How it helps one to understand that base
and extraordinary career! Everyone reading the story
of the Revolution should concentrate upon that man’s
ambition, weakness and intrigue. The origin of the
whole business was his false idea (unfortunately for
himself confirmed by circumstances for many years)
that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would have no
children. He came to regard himself as the heir, and
the natural result was that when the first child came
after so perplexing a delay (a delay the cause of which
I have explained in an appendix to my own monograph
on Marie Antoinette) Philippe Égalité felt himself
aggrieved. His grievance was illogical and unjust,
but it was there and in that grievance you find no
small part of the motive force that impelled the early
Revolution.</p>

<p>The family tradition carried on by the Tussauds
from the Revolution was what may be described as
the “orthodox” tradition. It is the tradition which
appears in this book. I am not sure that the historian
can wholly agree with it.</p>

<p>This “orthodox” tradition is the tradition of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
equable and happy society overthrown into a sort
of chaos at the head of which chance scoundrels floated,
each to disappear in turn, struck by a sort of anarchic
doom proceeding from their fellow anarchs. The Revolution
was rather a resettlement of society from a
state which had become unstable to a new and more
stable state, and its leaders were upon the whole,
though suffering under the exaggeration from which
leaders at such a time invariably suffer, men of capacity&mdash;especially
on the military side. Further, those
who were made responsible in popular tradition for
the worst excesses were hardly the principal authors
of them.</p>

<p>Thus, the real director of what is called the Terror
was Carnot, not Robespierre. Carnot was a perfectly
sane man and a genius to boot, attached to the new
democratic principle, but a soldier, and working for
the highly practical ends which a soldier has in view.
He thought of the Terror as a piece of martial law,
and it is significant that under his direction by far
the greater number of those who suffered in Paris suffered
through a direct breach of the temporary
regulations (such as those against the export of money
or communication with the enemy) which were necessary
for the prosecution of the campaign.</p>

<p>Robespierre was not the director of the Terror at
all. He was a man singularly restricted in nature, but
of powerful effect in oratory in spite of his close academic
style. He was a man of complete sincerity,
much too narrow in doctrine, but because he exactly
expressed with more lucidity than anyone else, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with more conviction, what was the passionate creed
of the time, he became for something like two years
at once the idol and the symbol of the revolutionary
masses. As the Terror looked like an intensive application
of the Revolution men associated it with Robespierre’s
name, and Robespierre, suffering from the
very grave defect of vanity (common in men who
reach a public position), was willing to allow the false
imputation, and to enjoy the title of ruler, when he
was really in the Central Council of the Republic, singularly
impotent. He paid a heavy price for that falsehood.
It cost him his life and&mdash;what was worse&mdash;his
reputation.</p>

<p>What we know positively of Robespierre’s action
during the Terror is that he attended the Central
Council less and less frequently, and that he tried, if
anything, to stop the Terror. In fact it was precisely
on this account, his interference with the rigour of the
martial law, that his enemies brought him to the guillotine.
But, by a curious irony not uncommon in
history, the death of this man who was not the leader
of the Terror, and who had if anything attempted to
check it, and who was put to death because he attempted
to check it, caused the Terror to cease. Men
had so universally (and so falsely) identified him with
the extremity of the republican military régime that
when he passed it was impossible to continue it.</p>

<p>In the matter of Marat what I may call “the Tussaud
tradition” is sounder. The man was unbalanced
to the point of lunacy, and when Madame Tussaud was
called in to take the impression of his face just after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
death, her use of the word “fiend” though exaggerated
is comprehensible. This effigy of Marat which you
may see in the famous gallery and which was modelled
immediately after his death&mdash;an immediate piece of
historical evidence of the first value&mdash;was shown in
Paris when it was completed. It is an astonishing
thing to have that piece of continuity with us.</p>

<p>But all these death masks of the Revolution are of
the highest value. There is an extraordinary dignity
in the full features of the Queen, looking younger than
she did in the last years of her life, and a singular and
awful reality in the mask of Robespierre. I know only
two representations of Robespierre which really recall
the man. One is this effigy exactly modelled from
the face itself after these last thirty-six hours of agony,
and the other is the portrait which Greuze made of
him and which is now in Lord Rosebery’s collection.
And of these two, of course, the death mask, though
repulsive, is the more actual.</p>

<p>But of all these revolutionary figures, by far the
most interesting to me is that of Carrier. The contrast
between that strongly exact, clearly cut face and
the story of Carrier’s madness at Nantes, is one of the
things that make one understand not only the Revolution
but in general mankind at white heat. Here is a
man who, if features mean anything, might have been
some sharp, self-contained, disappointed, ironic speaker,
or even poet. It is the face of a man who certainly
knew his own mind, who despised other men, which
is a weakness, but who followed some great idea
within. It is a face human in its self-repression and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
exactitude. Were we familiar with it in connection
with some great name of peaceable activity, were it
the face of one of those who settled the Congress of
Vienna, or of some monarch, or of some writer, it would
be famous as an index of genius. As it is, the name&mdash;especially
to those who do not know the face&mdash;suggests
nothing but a mad infamy, and indiscriminate
shooting and drowning in batches of the wretched
Vendean prisoners. And I myself when writing thus
of Carrier have a right to be balanced in my judgment
for he came very near to guillotining my grandfather’s
father, from whom he differed in politics. And here
in the case of Carrier is an excellent example of the
historical value of that which I postulate as the first,
much the greatest, character in a collection such as
this: for had we not the bust of the living Carrier, itself
almost a living thing, taken immediately after
death, we should hardly have guessed what Carrier
was. But the face combined with the history explains
him well enough.</p>

<p>The story of Madame Tussaud seeking for Sanson’s
guillotine, or rather for one of his guillotines
after the Peace of Amiens and sending her son over
to Paris to look for the man and his implements (which
the executioner had pawned) and getting it at last
at great cost, is characteristic of her energy and business
sense. She lived at a time when the material relic
was the <i lang="fr">clou</i> of her collection. If to-day it rather detracts
from the sober historical value of the figures, it
remains an excellent witness to her indefatigable initiative.
And so it is with the collection of Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
relics, notably the Waterloo carriage, which she secured
just at the moment when it was of the greatest
value to her business.</p>

<p>Her modelling of the dead in the revolutionary time
included, by her own account, the head of the Princess
de Lamballe, when that unfortunate and rather insipid
young woman (but gracious and kind) was so foolishly
and so atrociously murdered. The record would
seem to correspond more or less with the judgment
of Michelette, and Michelette’s portrait mostly produced
by chance illusion is the best I know.</p>

<p>In the fate of all those men and women, but particularly
in that of Madame de Lamballe, the main element
of tragedy is their bewilderment. They could
not conceive what cause or motive lay behind the fierce
hatred which concentrated upon them. It was for
them a nightmare, something irresponsible like a cataclysm
of nature, and yet something human, and something
that ought, therefore, to be explicable. Oddly
enough the one person who did get a glimmer of the
human motive at work was Marie Antoinette herself.
It is astonishing how rapidly not only the general
character but the intelligence of Marie Antoinette developed
in these years. She became the true daughter
of Maria Theresa&mdash;too late!</p>

<p>They suffered (of course) through that illusion
which is the curse of publicity. They were tortured
and they were killed for a label, not for their very
selves. But the tragedy is increased in their case, I
think, because they did not seek publicity. Your
politician, often a mountebank, whose appetite is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
strutting upon a stage, who loves the limelight, whose
meat and drink it is to hear his name repeated perpetually
by the populace, deserves what he gets. And
he nearly always gets what the fates reserve for such
vanities. In a greater or less degree these creators of
their own label suffer in the end: at the least disappointment
and neglect, at the most death. But as I
have said they deserve what comes to them. They
have had their reward. It was not so with the stable
hereditary publicity of the Bourbon royal family and
its adherents. They could not help the light which
beat upon them. They did not seek it. The absurd
legends in which any public figure is necessarily
clothed as with a wrap of falsehood is not one of their
seeking or of their making. They suffer for those
legends and for the consequences of those legends precisely
after the fashion which dramatic irony demands
that the victim of any great tragedy should suffer&mdash;in
spite of themselves and with no understanding of how
the thing came.</p>

<p>What could be more ridiculous than the figment of
Louis XV&mdash;obese, good-natured, slow, irresolute in
morals, irresolute in policy&mdash;as a tyrant. Or what
could be more absurd than the fiction of a libertine
Marie Antoinette? Or of a democratic Duke of Orléans?
Or of a patriot Necker?</p>

<p>It was, I think, this element of undeserved and
awfully ironic tragedy which burnt into the soul of
all those who had come into contact with the harmless
but sometimes dignified and always splendid circle of
Versailles. One of the few sincere emotions of Burke’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
life was, I think, the moment when he broke out into
rhetoric on the fate of the Queen. This middle-class
man had seen her, and the grotesque disproportion between
herself and her fate moved him to real feeling.
It is to his credit, for not many things that Burke said
were genuine. He was an advocate taking pay from
people who wanted arguments and I think he would
have argued just as well for better pay on the other
side.</p>

<p>This appassionate sympathy with and support of the
victims was very conspicuous in Madame Tussaud
herself. And she carried it through the whole of that
period when she was at first unwillingly modelling the
revolutionaries, often with disgust compelled to take
the mask of a dead face, or later (she was in prison
with Josephine) associated with the figures of the
period of the Directorate and the Consulship.</p>

<p>Of those personal interviews when that handsome
woman now in middle age was still engaged at her task
of modelling and sculpture in wax, there is none of
which we would rather have a full record than the
modelling of Napoleon. It is mentioned in Mr. Tussaud’s
book only by way of quotation from a contemporary
journal&mdash;the <i lang="fr">Belle Assemblée</i>. It would be
interesting to know if there is any family record giving
full details, for we have not even the date, though we
have the hour of the day&mdash;six o’clock in the morning&mdash;that
she first met the Emperor. He was not Emperor
yet and we can fix an inferior and a superior limit
easily enough for the portrait was made at the Tuileries,
after Napoleon as First Consul had gone there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
before the Peace of Amiens. It must, therefore, have
fallen within a period of only just over two years; it
must have been done either in 1800 or in 1801.</p>

<p>It is in connection with Napoleon that the shifting
of values, which I have suggested took place through
the transference of the collection to England, may be
noted. The exhibition once fixed in London took on
the English point of view and to that extent distorted
a full European impression. For instance, one of the
great features in the story of the collection is the visit
of the Duke of Wellington to the effigy of Napoleon,
and a well-known and almost famous picture was made
of the incident. I am old enough to remember many
people who spoke of it as though it was a most dramatic
moment in the history of the nineteenth century.
But no one with the full European sense would feel
like that. Wellington was not the great protagonist
against Napoleon. He was but one of fifty men opposed
to the Emperor. The defeat of Napoleon was
in Russia, and at Leipsic and at Waterloo, not at
Waterloo alone, and the victors of Waterloo were
Wellington and Blücher, neither of whom could have
succeeded without the other.</p>

<p>Of the figures added to the great collection after
Madame Tussaud’s death, of the figures which carry
on the historical record and continue to add to its
value, I am sure that the one of most interest for an
Englishman is that of Richard Burton. It was not
(apparently) modelled directly from life. But it was
modelled under the eye of Lady Burton herself, and
satisfied that critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The inclusion of such a figure is an example of
what I mean when I say that such a collection is a
valuable and continuous piece of historical evidence.
The greatness of Burton was missed. He was subject
to a boycott due in the main to his exposure of the
ritual murder at Damascus. His energetic but isolated
character did not square with that of the most of his
countrymen. And yet to have an Englishman so
uniquely English and to have recognised what a part
he was of the record of his time shows a sure instinct.</p>

<p>It is here that the chief danger imperilling the value
of the collection appears. And with that after so much
praise I would conclude.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud, it will be remembered, decided
at some time early in the 19th century to make continuous
additions to her collection as time went on,
to keep it up to date, to make it contemporary. It
was a natural decision and obviously necessary to the
conduct of the thing as a business enterprise. For
contemporaries will always desire to look at the portraits
of those who are for any reason notorious, rather
than to preserve the historical record. But save in
quite exceptional times, such as that of the Revolution,
which gave the collection its origin, there is always
the danger of a change in values. In the first place,
for a man to be notorious is not the same thing as for
a man to deserve fame. His notoriety may be of the
quality of fame rather than mere notoriety, and may
mature into fame, and yet not be a fame of that first
class which warrants an historical record. In either of
these two cases there is the danger of disproportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the collection, regarded as something of slight historical
value. But that disproportion may be remedied
by the removal of the figures.</p>

<p>The third danger attaching to the system is not
remediable. It is omission, and that is what I had
in my mind in the case of Burton. It is very unlikely
that a man producing a series of contemporary portraits
in the early part of James I’s reign would have included
William Shakespeare; or in the end of Victoria’s reign
a man so remarkable (though, of course, not on a great
scale) as Samuel Butler. There is always a certain
proportion of men in any generation with regard to
whom the careful observer can say with fair certitude
that posterity will require to know much more of them,
and who are yet for the moment not in the public eye.
Now the commercial necessities of an exhibition cannot
consider these men. They are of no value to the
crowd, and therein, I say, lies the danger. Let me
give an example.</p>

<p>I do not think (I may be wrong as I am speaking
in the negative of what is only a detail), I do not think
that there is in the Tussaud collection any model of
the great Carnot. Carnot was on the whole the most
virile of all that virile revolutionary group, and he
was one of the first half dozen of those who created
the modern world. In a military sense Carnot was the
tutor and creator of Napoleon. But it would certainly
not have occurred to any observer of popular feelings
(even if Carnot had been included) at the time, especially
of popular feelings with an eye to the English
market, that Carnot was worth preserving. To-day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
think most students of history would rather have a
really accurate study of Carnot than of even Robespierre.</p>

<p>If ever, which is possible, a collection of this sort
comes under the aid or patronage of the state, the
peril I speak of might in theory be removed: for the
state will endow. But as things are, the peril exists.
I mention it because I do sincerely regard this body
of effigies not as something concerned with as ephemeral
a function in the state as popular curiosity, still less
as a mere commercial venture, but rather&mdash;what I have
called it throughout this essay&mdash;a unique piece of historical
record. And history, I take it, is the indispensable
memory with which citizens should furnish
themselves if they are to understand their own state
and civilisation.</p>

<h1>THE ROMANCE OF
MADAME TUSSAUD’S</h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Mr. Tussaud first enters his father’s studio&mdash;Reverie&mdash;Madame Tussaud’s
uncle forsakes the medical profession for art&mdash;Madame’s
birth and parentage&mdash;A Prince’s promise.</p>

</div>

<p>It was at the age of fourteen and in the year 1872
that I first entered my father’s studio, and well
I remember the bright summer morning I passed its
threshold to place myself under his tuition.</p>

<p>It was an odd rememorative sort of place, the eeriness
of which sat uneasily on the mind of, I fear, a
somewhat jocose and irresponsible youth.</p>

<p>The surroundings somehow seemed to force upon
my mind the memories of men and things I must have
heard about or dreamt of, or with whom I had been
in some way made familiar. Moreover, the place was
so out of touch with the ordinary affairs of life, so
reposeful and secluded amid the din and turmoil of the
world outside.</p>

<p>The studio stood well in the rear of an old-world
residence, known as Salisbury House, in the parish
of Marylebone. Here the family had long lived.
The house confronted what, in my early days, was
then still designated the New Road. Upon its site
there has been since erected the imposing classic palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
designed to accommodate the hitherto poorly housed
Corporation of the borough.</p>

<p>Whenever I recall this eventful day there readily
springs to my mind the circumstance that I found
my father busily engaged in modelling a new portrait
of the Prince of Wales&mdash;the late King Edward&mdash;for
whose recovery from a very dangerous illness the nation
had recently held a Day of Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>From this day onward I may claim to have acted
as something more than a mere spectator of that long
procession of models wrought by my father’s diligent
hands. Each one necessitated the making of some
small sketch, some characteristic study, that has helped
to swell as strange a collection of memorials as ever
existed of men and events of bygone days.</p>

<p>It is amid these surroundings that I now sit to begin
the writing of these chapters; and a strangely engrossing
retrospect they reveal. Five generations of
my family have contributed towards them, and now,
on a modelling stool by my side, there stands the promising
work of a son who will, I trust, one day follow
me to carry on the work.</p>

<p>During the quietude of those hours that succeed the
labours of the day, and when the last studio hand
has closed the door behind him, I take the opportunity
of penning this brief history. Often in the moving
shadows of the twilight or in the flickering flame of a
falling ember I fancy I see life and movement in the
faces that gaze down upon me, quickened, as it were,
to respond to the memories their features evoke.</p>

<p>But for me, at least, there is little that is disquieting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in their scrutiny. For the most part they
are old familiars, and a long acquaintance has set us
wonderfully at our ease.</p>

<p>As the eye passes from the semblance of one celebrity
to that of another, how vividly they carry one’s
thoughts back through King Edward’s reign, the long
years Queen Victoria sat upon the throne, the days of
William IV, the reign and regency of “The First Gentleman
of Europe,” and far back into the days of good
“Farmer George”!</p>

<p>Even though set among the strong and characteristic
features of the leading men of these memorable reigns,
the striking countenance of Napoleon can be discerned
without hesitation, and his familiar features force me
in imagination to undergo the ordeal of crossing the
Channel to retrace the course this narrative takes and
discover my ancestress under the domination of the
First Consul, then pushing in hot haste his fortune at
the point of the bayonet, and fast traversing the hazardous
road leading to the throne of France.</p>

<p>Somehow we do not find this long and curious retrospect
illumined by any very strong ray of human
happiness. Even the overshadowing head and shoulders
of the great Napoleon do not conceal from our
vision the dismal heads of the revolutionists; indeed,
if they had been hidden from our sight, could these
ghoulish impressions ever be effaced from our memory?
And so, behind Bonaparte, one’s eyes sight the sinister
heads of Robespierre, Fouquier-Tinville, Carrier, Hébert&mdash;merciless
creatures who gambled with the lives
of their fellow men for high positions, and multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
these awful human stakes that they might hold themselves
secure.</p>

<p>There, too, in the falling light, one perceives the
faces of Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie Antoinette,
the two most notable and pitiful victims of the Reign
of Terror&mdash;a reign, forsooth, in which these ill-starred
sovereigns, the descendants of generations of kings,
were but the poorest and saddest of subjects.</p>

<p>The vista is long and hazy, but it is not too dim
for one to observe upon a bracket the visage of the
great Voltaire, with its leering eyes and sardonic grin.
His bust is <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> with the ponderous head of the
idealist Rousseau, with its heavy forehead and its short,
narrow chin.</p>

<p>And so face after face peers down upon me, carrying

<p class="caption">CHRISTOPHER CURTIUS</p>

<p class="captionsub">Uncle of Mme. Tussaud and founder of the Museum in Paris during
the French Revolution in the Boulevard du Temple. A Portrait
Study by John T. Tussaud.</p>

</div>

<p>In the year 1758, so far afield as the city of Berne,
a certain young Swiss, named Christopher Curtius, was
earnestly employing his days as a medical practitioner.</p>

<p>With the object of improving himself in his profession
he had taken to modelling the limbs and organs
of the human body in wax. He soon extended
the scope of his labours to the execution of many
miniature portraits in that same plastic material, and
gained the patronage of many of the leading members
of the aristocracy. In this work he succeeded well,
and towards his latter days in Berne he practised rather
as an artist than as a family doctor.</p>

<p>It is as the maternal uncle of Madame Tussaud,
the subject of these memoirs, that Christopher Curtius
comes under our consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Tussaud was the child of one Joseph Grosholtz,
who lost his life when serving on the Staff of
General Wurmser during the Seven Years’ War, a
couple of months or so before she was born. He was
of purely Swiss parentage, and the family to this day
prides itself on being of Burgundian Swiss stock.</p>

<p>Although Marie Grosholtz was not married until
the year 1795, it will be well to refer to her henceforth
as Madame Tussaud, under which name she is universally
known.</p>

<p>Madame Grosholtz and her child seem to have been
the only relatives possessed by Curtius, who later induced
his sister to take up her residency with him,
doubtless with the object of taking control of the
affairs of his household.</p>

<p>It was when Curtius had fully established himself
as an artist in Berne that an incident took place, about
the year 1762, which led to important consequences.</p>

<p>The Prince de Conti had been losing favour at the
Court of his royal cousin, Louis XV, a circumstance
mainly due, we are told, to the Prince’s excessive
popularity with the Army and a certain independent
bearing he adopted towards the King and his favourites.
The King’s mistress, Madame de Pompadour, did
not hesitate to show her resentment at de Conti’s lack
of deference.</p>

<p>According to all accounts, the Prince did not take
his position very much to heart, for, in truth, an estrangement
between the Court and the representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of his house afforded little in the nature of a new experience.
At any rate, he shook the dust of the capital
off his boots, and set out on a tour through Europe.</p>

<p>On this journey he tarried for some days in the
city of Berne, betraying a keen desire to participate
in all that mediæval town could afford him by way
of interest and entertainment.</p>

<p>Among these Curtius’s studio&mdash;which had now acquired
something of the dignity of a private museum&mdash;was
not allowed to escape his attention. No account
of his visit to this establishment has been handed
down, but a few words uttered by the Prince on leaving
conveyed, beyond all doubt, his genuine admiration
for the doctor-artist’s skill in his new profession
as a sculptor in wax.</p>

<p>“If you will leave Berne and come to Paris, I will
undertake to find you a suitable atelier in which to
carry on your work, and hold myself responsible for
your receiving as many commissions as you feel disposed
to executive. Come,” he urged. “You will not
regret it.”</p>

<p>One wonders what kindred foibles, what curious
traits of disposition in common, existed between this
Prince and the artist that there should have been struck
so readily a chord of sympathy between them. For the
offer, as we shall hereafter learn, had not been lightly
made, nor had its ready acceptance been inspired without
betraying a ready confidence most men would have
deemed it highly imprudent to concede.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Curtius leaves Berne for Paris&mdash;The Hôtel d’Aligre&mdash;The Court of
Louis XV&mdash;Madame arrives in Paris.</p>

</div>

<p>In response to the Prince de Conti’s invitation, Curtius
left Berne for Paris a few months later, and
for once the time-honoured adage proffering a warning
to those prone to rely upon the promises of princes
had no bearing, for this Prince kept his word.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Paris, Curtius found a handsome
suite of apartments awaiting him at the Hôtel d’Aligre,
hard by the Croix du Trahoir in the Rue St. Honoré.
They were spacious and well furnished, and in style
and comfort far exceeded his expectation. The Rue
St. Honoré on the north, the Rue Bailleul on the south,
the Rue de l’Arbre Sec on the east, and the Rue des
Poulies on the west, outline to this day the ground on
which the hotel, with its gardens, then stood.</p>

<p>The Hôtel d’Aligre was a place that had seen better
days. It had, like so many of the great family dwellings
that existed in Paris towards the end of the eighteenth
century, demanded of its owners a longer and
more speedily replenished purse than they possessed.
The sheltering of a stately and magnificent household
had long been unknown to this once famous residence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and its handsome rooms had been divided up and let
as separate tenements.</p>

<p>The building contained a fine <i lang="fr">salon</i>, which at one
time was placed by a Chancellor d’Aligre at the service
of the Grand Council, and so late as the year of Curtius’s
arrival in Paris we hear of it being used for an
exhibition of pictures displayed under the ægis of the
Académie de Saint Luc. Of this académie Curtius was
soon elected a member, and it may be presumed that
some of his own works were shown in the exhibition.</p>

<p>During its latter days the hotel figured under a
dual appellation, the ancient name of d’Aligre being
prefaced by that of the renowned Schomberg. Finally
it was known to the good citizens of Paris, shortly before
its total disappearance, as the Old Hôtel Schomberg
d’Aligre.</p>

<p>This building occupied a position that could hardly
have been better chosen for Curtius’s purpose, for it
stood in the very heart and throng of the busy capital&mdash;that
is to say, close to the Louvre and at no great
distance from the Tuileries&mdash;and was surrounded by
the houses of the wealthiest and most influential inhabitants
of the city.</p>

<p>We should like to follow the footsteps of Curtius,
and enter with him into his new home in Paris; but
with the meagre information we have concerning these
early days in his career we can only picture him as settling
down to his work and drawing around him many
famous patrons, to some of whom we shall have to
refer as we make progress with our story.</p>

<p>Doubtless the ideals he had conceived of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
capital as a citizen in far-off Berne would not have
squared with the actual state in which he found the
city when he took up his domicile within it.</p>

<p>Report had carried the splendours of Versailles far
beyond the frontiers of France, and might well have
enlivened the imagination of an artist like Curtius,
who, doubtless, would have hoped to enjoy the pleasure
of witnessing them for himself; but on his arrival in
the capital he found the glories of the palaces had set,
and that the Court of Louis XV had not only grown
dull, but had even gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>The King himself had become weary of the great
Court functions and sumptuous entertainments, and
now preferred to indulge in complete seclusion the
appetites that still remained to him. The military
exploits of his reign had not brought him any great
renown, and in recent years he had suffered reverses
that had cast a gloom over these closing days of his
life.</p>

<p>He had also been reminded more than once that
the levelling hand of Death took no heed of rank
and power. That dread visitor had already unceremoniously
claimed the King’s son (the Dauphin) and
his wife, and his own neglected Queen, Marie Leczinska,
was fast failing in health.</p>

<p>The temper of the people towards the King had
undergone a great change, and the days of “Well-Beloved”-ness
had long since departed. During the
reign of his predecessor, Louis XIV, the excessive taxation
and the state of semi-serfdom had been borne by
the lower classes with something like resignation, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they had received some compensation through the glory
of his military achievements and the extension of his
power. But small reason had they for so patiently
bearing the ever-increasing burdens that had signalised
the reign of his successor, Louis XV, whose military
exploits had brought the country little by way of
glory, and whose career had naught to show but a
long life of wanton extravagance, combined with a
painful disregard for the welfare of his people.</p>

<p>What Curtius did in the four years that succeeded
his arrival in Paris one cannot say for certain; but
there is little doubt that he was busily engaged in executing
commissions for his numerous and ever-increasing
list of patrons, whose liberality and kindness not
only equalled, but far surpassed, the Prince de Conti’s
promises.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that soon after his arrival Curtius
tried his deft hands upon a model of the Queen
of Louis XV, and it is this comparatively early work
that constitutes one piece among a mere half-dozen
examples that have been handed down to us. Probably
the influence of his friend, the Prince de Conti, aided
him in obtaining this commission.</p>

<p>It was after having practised his profession as artist
for some years that Curtius repaired to Berne for the
purpose of fetching his sister and her little daughter.</p>

<p>That was in the year 1766, and Madame Tussaud
was then about six years old. On the authority of
her <cite>Memoirs</cite>, published in 1838, it would appear that
she was born at Berne in the year 1760; but documentary
evidence exists which appears to indicate that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
birth actually took place a year later. Be that as it
may, we first hear of her when she accompanied her
mother to Paris as the guest of her uncle.</p>

<p>This brief review will not permit us to dwell long
on the early days of the young girl in Paris, nor on
those events that prefaced the outbreak of the Revolution.
Truth to say, between 1766 and 1789&mdash;a matter
of twenty-three years&mdash;the details concerning the
lives of Curtius and his niece are neither very full nor
very clearly defined. This seems to be all of a piece
with the nature of the work they produced, for it is
astonishing, having regard to the considerable output,
how small a quantity of it has been handed down to us.</p>

<p>One has, therefore, little material to assist him in
gaining an insight into the artists’ careers, or to guide
in the forming of a just opinion either as to the exact
character of their work or the nature of their subjects.
Miniatures in coloured wax, modelled in fairly high
relief and framed and glazed in the ordinary way as
pictures, seem to offer a general idea and the best conception
of the work that emanated from the studio during
these momentous years, so pregnant with meaning
for the near future.</p>

</div>

<p>The pity of the loss is that the work, taken direct
from life, afforded a faithful record of important personages.
Of this there is ample proof, and that the
models should have been of so ephemeral a character
is a matter of great regret, extending far beyond the
feelings of the artists’ descendants. Yet, when one
remembers the hatred of the populace towards the aristocrats
and those holding authority under the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Régime, it is not to be wondered at that many portraits
should have shared, with their originals, the
destructive effects of the antipathy that was shown
both to patrons of art and to the art itself. It goes
without saying that during the Reign of Terror people
would be disposed to hide, or even to destroy, any art
subject in their possession indicating their attachment
to the Royalists.</p>

<p>Life-size figures&mdash;Museum at the Palais Royal&mdash;Exhibition on the
Boulevard du Temple&mdash;Benjamin Franklin&mdash;Voltaire.</p>

</div>

<p>A good deal of hearsay and some incontestable
evidence helps to fill the hiatus between the
time Curtius came to Paris and the outbreak of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>Although the many years spent by Curtius in the
production of miniatures in coloured wax do not appear
to have brought him a very great or a very wide
reputation, yet they were the means of leading him
to the modelling of life-size portraits in this same material,
with the express intention of forming them into
a collection solely for the object of exhibiting them
to the public.</p>

<p>Now it is to this important departure in the treatment
of his works that we owe the present Madame
Tussaud’s Exhibition, an establishment with which his
name must be for ever associated.</p>

<p>He seems to have set his mind upon this venture
round about the year 1776, and some years later to
have opened a Museum of life-size portrait models at
the Palais Royal, an enterprise that was soon to be
followed by the opening of a second Exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a far more renowned and interesting character on the
Boulevard du Temple, to which we shall have occasion
to refer more than once.</p>

<p>The Museum at the Palais Royal seems to have
proved a lucrative concern, and to have been devoted
to the portraits of men and women of position, holding
for the time being a prominent place in the public
eye. Little is known concerning it, except for a few
meagre and commonplace references in the literature
of the period, and it may, to all intents and purposes,
be considered as relegated to the domain of the forgotten
past.</p>

<p>We shall not, however, find ourselves able to dispose
of the Exhibition on the Boulevard du Temple
without rendering an account of it, for in the course
of a few years it figured very largely in the Revolution,
and had associated with it several incidents of an
important and far-reaching character.</p>

<p>There is the record about this time of an acquaintance
between the sculptor and Benjamin Franklin, the
American statesman and philosopher.</p>

<p>Franklin had come to Paris in December, 1776, “to
transact the business of his country at the Court of
France,” his chief purpose being to obtain political
and financial assistance in consolidating the newly
formed United States of America.</p>

<p>Curtius and his niece&mdash;now a young woman of sixteen
years&mdash;had the pleasure of entertaining the Doctor,
who took considerable interest in their work. Not
only did he commission them to execute several distinct
portraits of himself, but he also ordered models of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
many other notable characters of the day. One of his
own portraits is the identical figure which has been
shown at Madame Tussaud’s ever since.</p>

<p class="caption">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</p>

<p class="captionsub">Modeled from life, in Paris, by Christopher Curtius
for his Exhibition.</p>

</div>

<p>This model was executed in 1783, in which year
Franklin assumed great prominence as one of the signatories
to the Treaty of Peace between the Mother
Country and the United States, which recognised the
latter as an independent nation. The figure in question
is a life-size one; but, in addition to this, Curtius,
aided by his capable niece, who was now earnestly
supporting her uncle in his work, produced several
miniature portraits of the statesman which went directly
into his possession. Indeed, it is well known that
Franklin had in his rooms in Paris many works that
had emanated from Curtius’s studio.</p>

<p>In Franklin’s <cite>Autobiography</cite> there is an account of
his home in Market Street, Philadelphia, in which he
finally settled, and the following extract under the
date 13th July, 1787, from a journal kept by an old
friend of his, the Reverend Dr. Manasseh Cutler, a
distinguished scholar and botanist, of Hamilton,
Massachusetts, who had recently paid him a visit,
shows that he took with him from Paris a number of
miniatures, many of which he had obtained from Curtius:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Over his mantel he has a prodigious number of
medals, busts and casts in wax or plaster of paris, which
are the effigies of the most noted characters in Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>When Franklin returned to America in 1785 there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sailed with him, on board the same ship, Houdon, the
eminent French sculptor, who had been in his early
student days a friend and companion of Curtius, who
engaged his services, and to whom he rendered considerable
assistance in his work.</p>

<p>Houdon’s skill was highly appreciated by Franklin,
and the object of the journey to America was that
the sculptor might execute a statue of Washington
for the State of Virginia, the instructions for the work
coming from both Franklin and Jefferson. The voyage
was made in the <i>London Packet</i>, and the date of
the embarkation was the 27th of July, 1785.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous man of this period was the
satirist, philosopher, and dramatist, Voltaire, who,
throughout the whole of his long life, had championed
the cause of the people against arbitrary and despotic
power.</p>

</div>

<p>After an absence of twenty-eight years the aged Voltaire
left his home on the shores of Geneva and returned
to Paris, arriving there on the 10th of February,
1778. He was welcomed by an ovation that might
well have befitted the homecoming of a great conqueror.</p>

<p>Curtius’s reputation at that time stood at its highest,
and Voltaire gave him several sittings soon after
his arrival. It is owing to this circumstance that the
artist was able to place among the models of his recently
opened Exhibition on the Boulevard du Temple
a life-size standing figure of this popular idol.</p>

<p>It is a matter of exceptional interest that the selfsame
figure still exists, and is shown to-day as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the most attractive and notable objects in Madame
Tussaud’s, where it has stood for just upon a century
and a half.</p>

<p>Besides producing this figure, Curtius took the opportunity
the sittings afforded him of executing several
miniature models, one of them representing the
philosopher during his last moments. To this he gave
the title of “The Dying Socrates.” Several copies of
this are known to exist, and we give an illustration
of the one in the Tussaud collection. These were the
last portraits produced of him from life, and they were
completed none too soon.</p>

<p>The stirring reception accorded Voltaire on his arrival
in Paris, to which he responded with great energy,
coupled with the strenuous effort and anxiety attending
his personal superintendence of his new tragedy, <cite>Irene</cite>,
soon affected his health. The sittings were given during
the months of March and April, and on the following

age of eighty-four.</p>

<p>In the year 1780 the ill-fated Louis XVI had been
six years on the throne, and Curtius by this time
had become well ingratiated with the followers of the
New Régime.</p>

<p class="captionsub">The Sister of Louis XVI and Patroness of Madame Tussaud.

</div>

<p>Among the many distinguished visitors who honoured
Curtius’s studio with their presence in 1780 was
one who was destined to exercise a great influence
on Madame Tussaud’s life. This was the King’s sister,
Madame Elizabeth of France, who, at the time we
speak of, was sixteen years of age. Her disposition
was singularly sweet and charming, and the keen interest
she took in the models and mysteries of the
studio caused her to bestow upon the niece of Curtius
very special attention.</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth, according to her young protégée,
was of medium height and slight build, her forehead
was high and intellectual, and she had kind, soft, blue
eyes. Her expression and demeanour were most sympathetic,
and on the slightest provocation her amiable
countenance became wreathed in smiles, the parting
lips revealing a perfect set of teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>So infatuated did Madame Elizabeth become with
this pleasant work of modelling in coloured wax, which
was soon to become a veritable craze, that she asked
Madame Tussaud to instruct her in the art, and for
that purpose invited her to live with her in her apartments
at the Palace of Versailles, for the Princess seldom
visited Paris.</p>

<p>Her overtures to his niece met with little opposition
on the part of Curtius, who, in spite of the fact that
he had decided leanings towards the cause of the people,
yet, in order to further his relative’s interests,
readily gave his permission to her accompanying the
Princess. This concession Curtius must have made
at some sacrifice, for it deprived him of his niece’s
society and of the help she was then rendering him
in his studio.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud accordingly bade her uncle farewell,
and left Paris for Versailles.</p>

</div>

<p>The quarters then occupied by Madame Elizabeth
were situated at the end of the façade of the south wing
of the palace, and looked out upon the Swiss Lake.</p>

<p>One wonders whether the fascinating work of modelling
in wax was the sole influence that prompted
Madame Elizabeth’s friendly feeling towards Madame
Tussaud. The Princess had already shown a marked
predilection for the Swiss, for both at the palace and
on her own private estate of Montreuil hard by she
had many Swiss people about her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, little is known of the life of Madame
Tussaud either at Versailles or at Montreuil,
which the King presented to his sister with the understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that she should continue to make Versailles
her official home until she attained the age of twenty-four.</p>

<p class="caption">MADAME ELIZABETH AT MONTREUIL</p>

<p class="captionsub">From a painting by Ricard in Versailles.</p>

</div>

<p>We are told that the Princess was very fond of
modelling sacred subjects, and many of these works
produced by her own hands she gave away to her
friends. She showed her attachment to Madame Tussaud
in many ways, and required her to sleep in an
adjoining apartment.</p>

<p>Curtius’s niece often found herself engaged in many
duties besides those associated with modelling in wax,
and it was no unusual thing for the girl to be made
the means of conveying alms to the Princess’s numerous
pensioners.</p>

<p>For nine years she enjoyed the confidence and almost
daily company of her patroness, and throughout
the long life vouchsafed to her she deemed them the
happiest she had known. Seldom could she be brought
to dwell upon these days, or call to mind the fate of her
illustrious pupil and the other members of the Royal
Family she then so often encountered, without the
tears, sooner or later, welling to her eyes. Indeed, not
even after the passage of some sixty years, when her
own days were drawing to a close, and when one might
have expected her grief to have become assuaged,
could she restrain her emotion at the memory of their
sad and tragic end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already referred to the second and larger
Exhibition opened by Curtius on the Boulevard du
Temple. A collection of wax figures representing famous
personages, living and dead, attired in their everyday
costume, and exhibiting their usual pose and attitude,
was known as a “Cabinet de Cire.”</p>

<p>The house wherein Curtius opened this second Exhibition
was formerly occupied by Foulon, the Minister
of Finance, who earned public execration by his ill-timed
suggestion that if the people could not get sufficient
bread they might eat hay. When the Revolution
broke out Foulon was one of the first victims for
the mob to vent its rage upon. They hanged him,
decapitated the body, and then paraded the streets
with his head stuck on a pike, between his lips being
placed a wisp of hay in memory of the cruel sneer at
the people’s want.</p>

<p>For his Exhibition Curtius modelled several notable
groups. Three of these call for some mention.</p>

<p>The first was a representation of the Royal Family
dining in public, a curious ceremonial of that period.
There was, within the walls of the Palace of Versailles,
a chapel whither the family repaired to hear mass every
morning; and on Sundays, after returning from prayer,
they held a grand <i lang="fr">couvert</i> in the palace. The dining-table
was in the form of a horseshoe, the <i lang="fr">Cent Suisse</i>
(or Swiss Bodyguard) formed a circle around it, and,
between them, the spectators were permitted to view
the august party at their dinner.</p>

<p>To this spectacle everyone had access, provided the
gentlemen were fully dressed&mdash;that is, had a bag-wig,
sword, and silk stockings&mdash;and the ladies were correspondingly
attired. Even if their clothes were threadbare
the visitors were not turned back; nor were they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
admitted, however well clad, unless they presented
themselves as etiquette prescribed.</p>

<p>The costume of the Swiss Bodyguard was magnificent,
being similar to that worn by Henry IV of
France. It comprised a hat with three white feathers,
short robe, red pantaloons or long stockings (all in
one, and slashed at the top with white silk), black
shoes with buckles, sash, sword, and halbert.</p>

<p>The Royal Family generally remained three-quarters
of an hour at table. The spectacle was such an
interesting one that Curtius, ever alive, as his successors
have been, to satisfy the popular imagination,
modelled a group for his Exhibition depicting the incident.</p>

<p>The second tableau represented an Indian group.
In the grounds of the Palace of Versailles are two residences,
the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon, the
latter having been a favourite retreat of Marie Antoinette
because of its secluded position and charming
attractions.</p>

<p>Curtius&mdash;assisted by his niece, who was now a full-grown
woman, sensible of her responsibilities, and able
to execute commissions of her own&mdash;modelled a group
of figures, consisting of the envoys of Tippoo Sahib
and several sepoys in their picturesque Eastern costumes,
which was arranged under a tent placed in the
Grand Trianon.</p>

<p>Tippoo Sahib was the Sultan of Mysore, and he
had sent to Louis XVI to invoke his assistance in expelling
the British from his dominions.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August, 1788, after spending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
night at the Grand Trianon, the envoys were escorted
to the Palace of Versailles, and received with great
pomp.</p>

<p>This was one of the last occasions on which Madame
Elizabeth appeared in public at the palace and
on which the King was able to receive freely the representatives
of a foreign Power. The winter that followed
was long and severe, and had much to do with
hastening the outbreak of the Revolution and the
downfall of the monarchy.</p>

<p>We do not know for certain whether the commission
for the third group was prompted by Madame
Elizabeth or by Marie Antoinette herself, but we know
for certain that it was one of the groups shown in the
Petit Trianon before those disturbing elements manifested
themselves that heralded the terrible upheaval
which was to come. The tableau comprised the seated
figures of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette with their
young children, the Dauphin and the Duchesse d’Angoulême,
all attired in full Court costume.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Models taken from life and exhibited for some time in Le Petit
Trianon at Versailles.</p>

</div>

<p>A very special interest attaches to this group, inasmuch
that, except for the renovation necessitated by
the long passage of time, it is now shown within the
walls of the present Exhibition exactly as it was
when first modelled.</p>

<p>While Madame Tussaud was fully occupied at Versailles
her uncle was busy with his Museum in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1783 Curtius added to his collection on the Boulevard
du Temple the “Caverne des Grands Voleurs,”
which we may fairly regard as the forerunner of the
present Chamber of Horrors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems to be some doubt as to the distinctive
character of Curtius’s two Exhibitions. One authority
informs us that his rooms at the Palais Royal contained
the effigies of famous and celebrated men, and that
the venture on the Boulevard du Temple was devoted
to those of notorious and infamous scoundrels. One
cannot say for certain what were the characteristics of
the two collections at this time, but there can be no
doubt that both attracted great numbers of people for
a very long period.</p>

<p>The descriptive accounts of Parisian amusements of
the time make mention of Curtius’s “Cabinet de Cire”&mdash;or,
to make use of the titles given to it on a copperplate
etching of that period by Martial, “Théatre des
Figures de Cire, ou Théatre Curtius”&mdash;as a sight well
worthy of inviting the attention of persons of rank
and condition. “One may see,” said Dulaure in 1791,
“waxen coloured figures of celebrated characters in
all stations of life.”</p>

<p>Upon closing the Exhibition at the Palais Royal,
Curtius conveyed its figures to the Boulevard du Temple,
wherein merged all the models that had been
previously on view, thus combining the peculiar characteristics
of the two establishments and constituting
the Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition as we know it to-day.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Eve of the French Revolution&mdash;Necker and the Duke of Orléans&mdash;Louis
XVI’s fatal mistakes&mdash;His dismissal of the people’s
favourites.</p>

</div>

<p>We are now approaching the day when the long-pent-up
storm, threatening for so great a while,
was about to burst, and we must contemplate King
Louis XVI and his advisers seeking for a means to
placate a people at last stirred to resentment through
the cruel and unjust burdens it had for generations
been made to bear.</p>

<p>The murmurings which had long been general and
indefinite were now resolving themselves into a hatred
fast becoming focused upon the rich and the powerful,
many of whom, it must be added, were also arrogant
and dissolute.</p>

<p>A rude awakening among some of these, who had
at last been brought to realise the imminence of the
convulsion, induced them to advocate with much haste
and little discretion certain concessions. These were
obviously granted as acts of expediency, and with as
little derogation as possible from their own interest,
rather than out of any sympathy for a distressed and
desperate people clamouring for relief.</p>

<p>So, early in 1789, the King was prompted to resort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to an expedient which had not been adopted since the
year 1614. He summoned the States-General to meet
together at Versailles on the 5th of May, 1789.</p>

<p>In the deliberations of this National Council the
King and his Ministers looked for support and guidance
to meet the difficulties that beset them. But matters
took an unexpected course. The Deputies of the
Third Estate, which out-numbered the First and Second
put together, demanded that all three Estates
should sit and vote as one whole indissoluble body. In
spite of opposition they pushed their demand to a successful
issue, and, grasping control of both legislative
and executive power, forthwith resolved themselves
into a permanent constitutional assembly.</p>

<p>The King soon found himself confronted by an irresistible
authority, including a majority of men who betrayed
little concern for his prerogative, and manifested
a strong sympathy with the cause of the people.</p>

<p>In such stirring times as those which were now being
experienced in France, Curtius turned to the advocates
of the people’s cause for many of his subjects
for his new Exhibition. Among these were many who
were to figure largely in the Revolution.</p>

<p>Special mention must be made of two figures, added
about this date, namely, Necker and Philippe, Duke
of Orléans, for their models had an important bearing
upon the events that followed.</p>

<p>Necker, at the time his model was made by Curtius
and Madame Tussaud, was the French Minister of
Finance. In 1775 he had claimed for the State the
right of fixing the price of grain and, if necessary, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
prohibiting exportation; a year later he was made
Director of the Treasury, and in 1777 he became Director-General
of Finance.</p>

<p>His retrenchments were bitterly opposed by Queen
Marie Antoinette; and his famous <i lang="fr">Compte Rendu</i>, in
1781, occasioned his dismissal at that time. Some of
his measures, such as his adjustment of taxes and his
establishment of State-guaranteed annuities and State
pawnshops, were a boon to suffering France. He retired
to Geneva, but in 1787 returned to Paris, and,
when M. de Calonne cast doubt on the <i lang="fr">Compte Rendu</i>,
he published a justification which drew upon him his
banishment from Paris.</p>

<p>Recalled to office in September, 1788, he quickly
made himself a popular hero by recommending the
summoning of the States-General, to which reference
has already been made.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, 1789, he received the royal
command to leave France at once; but the fall of the
Bastille, three days later, frightened the King into
recalling him, amid the wildest popular enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;" id="illus11">

<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="380" height="200" alt="" />

<p class="caption">MODEL OF THE BASTILLE</p>

</div>

<p>The Duke of Orléans, the famous Égalité, was another
hero of the people at this time. He was looked
upon coldly at Court owing to his dissolute habits.</p>

<p>London was frequently visited by him, and he became
an intimate friend of the Prince of Wales, afterwards
George IV. He infected young France with
Anglomania in the form of horse-racing and hard
drinking, and made himself popular among the lower
classes by profuse charity.</p>

<p>In 1787 he showed his liberalism boldly against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the King, and as the States-General drew near he
lavished his wealth in flooding France with seditious
books and papers. In the following year he promulgated
his <cite>Délibérations</cite>, written by Laclos, to the effect
that the Third Estate was the nation; and in June,
1789&mdash;the month that preceded the fall of the Bastille&mdash;he
led the forty-seven nobles who seceded from their
own order to join that Estate.</p>

<p>The Duke presumed to become constitutional King
of France, or at least Regent; but he was only a comparatively
small fragment that drifted into the vortex
of the Revolution itself. In 1792, when all hereditary
titles were swept away, this “citizen” adopted the name
of Philippe Égalité.</p>

<p>He was the twentieth Deputy for Paris in the National
Convention, and voted for the death of the
King; but in the following year retribution overtook
him, for he himself was found guilty of conspiracy
and guillotined.</p>

<p>The public distrust of the King’s party, the fatal
error in bringing the foreign troops to Paris and its
environs, and, finally, the banishment of Necker and
the Duke of Orléans, the great champions of the
people, must be regarded as the immediate cause of the
catastrophe that followed.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud recalled from Versailles&mdash;The 12th of July, 1789&mdash;Busts
taken from Curtius’s Exhibition&mdash;A Garde Française slain
in the mêlée.</p>

</div>

<p>It must be remembered that the “romance” of Madame
Tussaud’s began in the French capital one
hundred and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>As we view to-day the quaint little figure of Madame
which stands in the Exhibition she helped to
found in France and established in this country, we
must imagine her in the full vigour of her young
womanhood, sensible to the dangers and terrors of
the Revolution in which she was about to be involved.
The Exhibition was as yet in its infancy; but stirring
times were approaching, and the days were pregnant
with meaning for the France that was to be&mdash;a time
of bloodshed and grim ruthlessness born of a people’s
desire for freedom, and attended by ghastly scenes in
Paris that revealed the extremities to which unbridled
human passions could go.</p>

<p>We must see through her eyes the sights that marked
the red dawn of the French Revolution; and hear
the first low rumble that gave warning of the approach
of the Reign of Terror. Her uncle recalled her
from the Court of Versailles, an order that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
afford her his protection, and she did not leave a whit
too soon.</p>

<p>Now we come to the fateful days of July.</p>

<p>The Three Estates had been fused into one on the
27th of June with the assent of the King, who thus
virtually signed his own death-warrant. Another step
soon followed in the same disastrous course. The
Queen and her intimate advisers caused Louis to make
an attempt to maintain his authority by force, and
for this purpose an army of 40,000 men, drawn from
various quarters, was concentrated upon Paris and its
vicinity, and placed under the orders of Marshal Broglie.</p>

<p>Among these troops were several regiments of Swiss
and Germans. At that moment Necker, whom the
Court party distrusted and feared, was forced to relinquish
his office, and commanded to leave France
forthwith.</p>

<p>The 12th of July was a Sunday, and on the morning
of that day an extraordinary degree of activity
was observed among the troops in Paris. The nerves
of the people became overwrought; they were apprehensive
of imminent danger&mdash;some hidden design, some
sinister motive, on the part of the newly appointed
Ministers (including the hated Foulon, who had succeeded
the beloved Necker) whose policy they could
not fathom.</p>

<p>Before midday the Palais Royal was crowded with
people, wondering what all this military movement
could mean, and gazing at the strange placards which
bade them stay at home and avoid all meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The half-discredited rumour of the dismissal of
Necker spread like wild-fire through the capital, and
the first person who made the announcement was about
to be ducked in one of the water basins in the gardens
of the Palais Royal, when a Deputy of the Third
Estate, who happened to be standing by, confirmed the
news.</p>

<p class="caption">CAMILLE DESMOULINS</p>

<p class="captionsub">Young enthusiast who stirred the populace of Paris to
riotous demonstration on hearing of the dismissal of
Necker.</p>

</div>

<p>Everyone in the gardens was at once made acquainted
with the fall of the people’s favourite; and as the
cannon of the Palais made known, as usual, the fact
that the hour of noon had arrived, a young man named
Camille Desmoulins sprang upon a table outside the
Café Foy, and, brandishing a drawn sword and pistol,
called “To arms!” He then harangued with burning
eloquence the people who crowded around him, and
fired their imagination at the close of his oration by
plucking a leaf from a tree (green being the colour
of Necker’s livery) and placing it in his hat as a cockade,
an example that was followed by thousands.</p>

<p>The theatres and other places of amusement were
closed as a sign of mourning for Necker, who was
loudly acclaimed on every side.</p>

<p>Then it was suggested that the models of Necker and
the Duke of Orléans should be obtained from Curtius’s
Museum. The idea was quickly seized upon,
and the crowd rushed <i lang="fr">en masse</i> to the Exhibition rooms
on the Boulevard du Temple, where they demanded
the busts of the “friends of the people.” They also
asked for the model of the King, a request that was refused
by Curtius, who observed that as the full-length
figure was extremely heavy it would be “broken” if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
carried. This reply pleased the people, who clapped
their hands and shouted “Bravo, Curtius, bravo!”</p>

<p class="caption">M. NECKER</p>

<p class="captionsub">Director-General of Finance under Louis XVI, whose bust, taken
from Curtius’s exhibit by the mob, was carried through the streets
of Paris to fan the flame of revolution.</p>

</div>

<p>Deeming it imprudent not to respond to the public
clamour, Curtius relinquished the busts of the two
public idols; and as soon as they had gained possession
of them the mob shouted “Long live Necker!” “Long
live the Duke of Orléans!” and “Down with the foreign
troops!”</p>

<p>As an expression of grief at the loss of their favourites
they covered the busts with crape. Then, elevating
them upon pedestals, they carried them through the
streets of Paris in triumph.</p>

<p>On rolled the procession through the Rue de Richelieu,
the Boulevard, the streets of St. Martin, St.
Denis, and St. Honoré, increasing in numbers at every
step, among them men of the Garde Française, till it
came to the Place Vendôme, where the busts were carried
twice round the statue of Louis XIV. <i lang="fr">En route</i>
the crowd obliged all they met to take off their hats in
honour of the men the busts represented. By the time
the great throng reached the Place Vendôme it had
become 5,000 or 6,000 strong.</p>

<p>Here a detachment of royal troops came up, and
vainly attempted to disperse the mob. The crowd
pelted the soldiers with stones, and, having put them
to flight, proceeded to the Place Louis XV, where they
were assailed by the German troops of the Prince de
Lambesc. The cavalry charged the mob with drawn
sabres, and the bearers of the busts were thrown down
beneath their burdens.</p>

<p>Again and again they were raised, only to fall once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
more. The figure of Necker was cleft asunder by a
soldier of the Royal German Regiment. A man named
Pepin, a hawker of articles of drapery, was wounded
by a bullet in the leg, and fell by the side of the
broken figure. That representing the Duke of Orléans
escaped destruction; but a member of the Civic Guard,
while endeavouring to protect it, lost his life, and
several other persons were wounded in attempting to
assist him. It was the first blood shed in the Revolution,
which may thus be regarded as having broken out
at the very doors of the Exhibition in Paris.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle gives, in his <cite>French Revolution</cite>, the
following characteristic account of the incident:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO ARMS!</p>

<p class="center">Sunday, 12th July, 1789.</p>

<p>France, so long shaken and wind-parched, is probably at
the right inflammable point. As for poor Curtius who, one
grieves to think, might be but imperfectly paid, he cannot
make two words about his Images. The Wax-bust of Necker,
the Wax-bust of D’Orléans, helpers of France: these, covered
with crape, as in funeral procession, or after the manner of
suppliants appealing to Heaven, to Earth, and Tartarus itself,
a mixed multitude bears off. For a sign! As indeed
man, with his singular imaginative faculties, can do little or
nothing without signs: Thus Turks look to their Prophet’s
Banner; also Osier <em>Mannikins</em> have been burnt, and Necker’s
Portrait has erewhile figured, aloft on its perch.</p>

<p>In this manner march they, a mixed, continually increasing
multitude; armed with axes, staves, and miscellanea; grim,
many-sounding through the streets. Be all Theatres shut; let
all dancing on planked floor, or on the natural greensward,
cease! Instead of a Christian Sabbath, and feast of <i lang="fr">guinguitte</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
tabernacles, it shall be a Sorcerer’s Sabbath; and Paris, gone
rabid, dance&mdash;with the Fiend for piper!</p>

<p>However, Besenval, with horse and foot, is in the Place Louis
Quinze. Mortals promenading homewards, in the fall of the
day, saunter by, from Chaillot or Passy, from flirtation and a
little thin wine; with sadder step than usual. Will the Bust-Procession
pass that way? Behold it; behold also Prince Lambesc
dash forth on it, with his Royal-Allemands! Shots fall,
and sabre-strokes; Busts are hewed asunder; and, alas, also
heads of men. A sabred Procession has nothing for it but to
<em>explode</em>, along what streets, alleys, Tuileries Avenues it finds;
and disappear. One unarmed man lies hewed down; a Garde
Française by his uniform; bear him (or bear even the report
of him) dead and gory to his Barracks;&mdash;where he has comrades
still alive!&mdash;<cite>French Revolution</cite>, Chapter IV.</p>

<p>It is no part of our concern to trace the course of
the Revolution throughout, or to dwell too long

passed into tranquil days she had to suffer the
severest ordeal of her life, the memory of which she
could never wholly efface.</p>

<p>We can hardly imagine her bitter experience when
compelled to employ her young hands in taking impressions
of heads immediately after decapitation, and
this, strange to say, by the very same knife which may
be seen at this day among the relics of the Revolution
at Tussaud’s.</p>

Robespierre, Carrier, Fouquier-Tinville&mdash;the best and

tasks of faithfully recording their features imposed
upon the young woman who was destined to bring
to England that Exhibition the annals of which we
now relate.</p>

<p>No wonder many a heated controversy has waged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
around these works, for it is hard to realise that they
are the actual impressions of those heads that fell
under the knife of the guillotine. Yet they are the
selfsame impressions that were shown at Christopher
Curtius’s Museum in Paris.</p>

<p>That Madame Tussaud’s uncle would have had the
temerity to exhibit spurious heads to a crowd by no
means in a humour to be trifled with, and far too
familiar with the features the casts portrayed to be
deceived, is more than unlikely; and we know such an
imposition in his case would have been quite unnecessary.
The casts were undoubtedly taken under compulsion,
either with the object of pandering to the
temper of the people, or of serving as confirmatory
evidence of execution having taken place&mdash;perhaps
both.</p>

<p>The idea of exhibiting the heads of those who had
been done to death as enemies of the people had asserted
itself during the very earliest days of the Revolution.
Within a fortnight of the taking of the Bastille,
Foulon’s head had been severed from its body and
paraded through the streets of Paris at the end of a
pike.</p>

<p>On that terrible day, the 10th of August, 1792,
when the Swiss Guard was cut to pieces in defending
the Tuileries, several of these brave soldiers had their
heads stuck upon pikes and exhibited to the mob. The
Royalist writer, Suleau, suffered the same fate.</p>

<p>How far had Madame Tussaud been implicated
in the accomplishment of the dreadful work of taking
casts from decapitated heads?</p>

<p>It was during the autumn of 1789 that Christopher
Curtius (who had by this time adopted Marie as his
daughter) insisted upon her withdrawing from the
service of Madame Elizabeth, to whom she had, with
every reason, become devotedly attached. For Curtius
had, at the outset of the disturbances in Paris, espoused
the cause of the people, and, as an adroit and far-seeing
man, had become anxious for his adopted daughter’s
safety.</p>

<p>He, without doubt, desired she should return under
his own roof to derive the benefit of his protection.
So it is that we find Marie in her uncle’s studio adjoining
his Exhibition, and where that gruesome work
was so soon to be undertaken.</p>

<p>Now during the year 1793 Curtius had been drawn
into the service of the National Convention, and on
several occasions had to quit Paris for many days at
a time, leaving Marie and her mother to do the best
they could with the Exhibition during his absence.
He was at this time “Envoy Extraordinary of the Republic
and War Commissary at Mayence.” On the
last occasion of his quitting the capital his absence extended
over a period of fully eighteen months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile heads were falling fast, and no one
knew how long his own would repose upon his shoulders.
Then it was that Marie suffered the terrible experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of having to take the impressions of so many
heads that were brought to her from the guillotine.
We have it from her own mouth that it was a task
with which she dared not hesitate to comply.</p>

<p>It must have been known to many that only a few
years back she had been a member of the household
of the King’s sister, Madame Elizabeth, at Versailles,
and not a few of those who were near and dear to her
had suffered death for a far less offence than that.
But at last, as the days wore on, the Jacobins themselves
fell, and the Reign of Terror gave way to the
Directorate. Then easier times came, though still far
from tranquil. Nevertheless heads had ceased to fall,
and Sanson, the executioner, finding his occupation
gone, pawned his guillotine, and got into woful trouble
for alleged trafficking in municipal property.</p>

<p>Years after Madame came to this country she sent
her son to Paris to search out this terrible instrument
of death, and, with the help of the executioner, who
was still living, and who solemnly vouched for its authenticity,
she secured the knife, the lunette, and also
the chopper that was used as a standby, lest the great
knife should fail.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Years after, Madame Tussaud, with the aid of the executioner,
procured these for her collection.</p>

</div>

<p>It was only after much negotiation and the payment
of a very considerable sum of money that her
object was attained. And now the dread knife harmlessly
reposes by the side of the impressions of those
heads it so ruthlessly struck off a century and a quarter
ago&mdash;that of Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie Antoinette,
as well as those of Robespierre, Danton, Fouquier-Tinville,
Hébert, and the miscreant of Nantes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Carrier. From the time they were first shown in Paris
until the present day they have been viewed by an
ever-increasing throng, though the sight of them can
never have been pleasing, and those who gaze upon
them shudder and pass on.</p>

<p>Though Madame Tussaud did not witness the execution
of Marie Antoinette, yet she remembered seeing
the Queen pass on a tumbril through the jeering crowds
to the scaffold. The once gay and light-hearted Queen
was dressed in white for her last pageant on earth,
her hands tied behind her. The spectacle brought back
to Madame memories of the royal palace where she had
frequently attended to give lessons in modelling, and
she was so overcome that she fainted. Perhaps the
most horrifying experience undergone by Madame Tussaud
during this terrible period was when the mangled
head of the greatly beloved Princess de Lamballe was
brought to her that a cast might be made. In vain
did she protest that she could not endure the ordeal.
The brutal murderers compelled her to comply.</p>

<p>One of the most bloodthirsty of all the red Terrorists
was Jean Paul Marat, who was slain in
his bath by Charlotte Corday on the 13th of July,
1793.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;" id="illus19">

<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="" />

<p class="caption">CHARLOTTE CORDAY</p>

</div>

<p>Marat, as a young man, had lived in this country
for some time, and was well known to Madame Tussaud
through visits he paid to the house of her uncle,
Curtius, at 20 Boulevard du Temple.</p>

<p>Immediately after his assassination she was called
upon to take a cast of Marat’s head. “They came
for me,” she relates, “to go to Marat’s house at once,
and to take with me what appliances I needed to make
an impression of his features. The cadaverous aspect
of the fiend made me feel desperately ill, but they
stood over me and forced me to perform the task.”
Marat’s model is still to be seen in the Exhibition lying
in the bath in which he was stabbed by the heroic
young Norman girl.</p>

<p>Charlotte Corday had addressed a letter to Marat
stating that she had news of importance to communicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and when she called he readily admitted her.
She amused him with an account of the Deputies at
Caen, when he said. “They shall all go to the guillotine.”
“To the guillotine!” exclaimed she, and as he
took up a pencil to write the names of his intended
victims Charlotte plunged a knife into his heart.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud afterwards visited Charlotte Corday
in the Conciergerie Prison, and described her as
tall, well-mannered, and possessed of many graces of
character and appearance. The brave young woman,
who paid for her avenging act with her life, wrote in
a letter to her father that she had done what was
right. After the heroine’s death Madame Tussaud
obtained a record of Charlotte Corday’s beautiful face.</p>

</div>

<p>The actual model, now in our Exhibition, of Marat
dying in his bath, was exhibited during the Revolution
at the Museum of Curtius in Paris, and attracted
crowds, who were loud in their lamentations, for at
that time Marat was a national idol.</p>

<p>Robespierre visited the Museum, and took the opportunity
of haranguing the people at the door. In flamboyant
language he said, “Enter, citizens, and see the
image of our departed friend, snatched from us by the
assassin’s hand, guided by the demon of aristocracy.
Marat was the father of the poor, the defender of
the weak, and the consoler of the wretched. As his
heart poured forth the sweet emotions of sympathy for
the oppressed, so did the vigour of his mind emit its
thunder against the oppressor.” Then, descending to
bathos, the cunning demagogue exclaimed, “What did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he get for it all? Five francs were found in his
house!”</p>

<p>Surprise has sometimes been expressed by visitors
that the bath in which Marat was stabbed to death
should be so small and of such a curious shape.</p>

<p>Marat was murdered in a “slipper” bath, which
was more like a “halt boot” than a slipper, so that the
water would come up to the shoulders of the bather
without flowing over. This kind of bath was greatly in
vogue at the time of the French Revolution. Its object
was to save water, which in those days was not
freely supplied. When the bather was in the bath a
small quantity of water would fill it.</p>

<p>Maximilien Robespierre had sent numerous people
to their death during the Reign of Terror. His own
turn came at last, when he too met his death from
the sharp tongue of La Guillotine. The revulsion of
feeling that had set in against Robespierre was very
bitter. He was shot at point-blank range by a man
named Meda in the Salle d’Égalité, a room in the
Hôtel de Ville, but was only wounded, and he went to
the guillotine on the 28th of July, 1794, with his
broken jaw swathed in a white linen cloth.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Impression of his head taken immediately after he had been guillotined,
28th July, 1794. One of the impressions done by Madame
Tussaud, then a young girl, by order of the authorities.</p>

</div>

<p>An hour after the head of Robespierre rolled from
the lunette Madame Tussaud, reluctantly obeying a
demand that an impression should be taken of the
severed head, set about the shuddering task. The cast
therefrom is now shown in one of our Exhibition rooms
containing relics of the Revolution. Her feelings may
be imagined as she sat with the head of the callous
Terrorist confronting her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Madame Tussaud took an impression of
the features of Robespierre directly after his execution,
she had taken a portrait of him long before his
fall. He expressed a wish that his figure should be
introduced standing near that of Marat, as also those
of Collot d’Herbois and Rosignol. He proposed that
they should send their own clothes in which the figures
might be dressed, to afford additional accuracy. The
likenesses were taken and apparelled as desired.</p>

<p>In those days Madame Tussaud often sat next Robespierre
at dinner. She describes him as always extremely
polite and attentive, never omitting those little
acts of courtesy which are expected from a gentleman
when sitting at table with a lady, anticipating her
wishes, and taking care that she should never have
to ask for anything. In this particular, says Madame
Tussaud, he differed from Marat, who was so selfishly
eager to supply his own wants that he never troubled
himself with the needs of others.</p>

<p>Robespierre’s conversation was generally animated,
sensible, and agreeable, but his enunciation was not
good. There was nothing particularly remarkable in
his conduct, manners, or appearance when in society.
If noticed at all, it could only be as a pleasant, gentlemanly
man of moderate abilities. This was a strong
admission for a lady who was always a Royalist at
heart and had been long detained in Paris against
her will.</p>

<p>Her association with the Court of Louis inevitably
brought Madame Tussaud under suspicion of the so-called
Committee of Public Safety, and for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
she was imprisoned with Madame de Beauharnais, who
was later to become the Empress Josephine, whom
Napoleon divorced to marry Marie Louise. The scene
is changed, and we see Marie Grosholtz&mdash;Curtius having
died about that time&mdash;wedded in 1795 to François
Tussaud, by whose name she was henceforth to be
known to posterity.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud, it would appear, made the acquaintance
and gained the favour of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>A Parisian publication, <cite>La Belle Assemblée</cite>, gives
a circumstantial account of Madame Tussaud being
sent for to take the likeness of Napoleon&mdash;when he was
First Consul&mdash;at the Tuileries as early as six o’clock
in the morning. It would appear that Madame went
at the invitation of Napoleon’s first wife, Josephine,
who was desirous of having a permanent record of her
husband’s features. The young modeller was ushered
into a room at the palace where the great soldier waited
for her. <cite>La Belle Assemblée</cite> states that Josephine
greeted Madame Tussaud with kindness, and conversed
much and most affably. Napoleon said little, spoke
in sharp sentences, and rather abruptly.</p>

<p>He would have shown her special consideration had
she chosen to remain in France; but it is not to be
wondered at that Madame Tussaud cared no longer
to remain amid the sorrowful recollections of the Revolution,
and that she seized the opportunity, on the
signing of the Peace of Amiens, to leave France for
ever. It was to England she turned for refuge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the prosecution of her life’s work. Madame boldly
transported across the Channel to England her uncle’s
two Paris Exhibitions, which, as already related, had
been made into one. Here she decided to settle, and
here her descendants have lived ever since.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud leaves France for England, never to return&mdash;Early

</div>

<p>Madame Tussaud arrived in this country
with her Exhibition some time in May, 1802.</p>

<p>There is considerable difficulty in tracing her movements
during the first few years after her arrival. The
information points to her having remained in London
with her Exhibition for some six or seven years. In
London there is some amount of evidence of her having
shown her exhibits in Fleet Street and also at the
Lowther Arcade in the Strand.</p>

<p>However, it is fairly clear that she first showed her
collection at the old Lyceum Theatre in the Strand,
then known as the English Opera House, which she
vacated in 1803 that Mr. Winsor might make the experiment
of lighting the place with gas. It was the
first house of entertainment to be illuminated in this
way, and the innovation was regarded as dangerous.</p>

<p>Then she went on tour, and visited the more important
places in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Wherever the town visited boasted a Mayor, the Exhibition
was almost invariably opened by him, or under
his auspices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The figures that Madame Tussaud modelled and
the dates when she executed the work give some idea
of her activities at the time.</p>

<p>She modelled from life Queen Caroline in 1808,
George III in 1809, and Alexander I, Emperor of Russia,
in 1814. In that year the Emperor and the King
of Prussia visited England in connection with the centenary
of the House of Hanover, which took place on
the 1st of August.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud also modelled from life Mrs. Siddons,
the famous actress, who retired from the stage
in 1809, and died at her residence in Upper Baker
Street in 1831.</p>

<p>Princess Charlotte of Wales (daughter of George
IV) was married on the 2nd of May, 1816, and on
that day Her Royal Highness sat to Mr. P. Turnerelli,
the sculptor, for what was called “the Nuptial Bust.”
From this Madame Tussaud modelled a figure of the
Princess for the Exhibition, and it drew large numbers
of people to see it when the young Princess died in the
year following her marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of York was modelled from life in 1812,
Leopold I, King of Belgium, in 1817, the Bishop of
Norwich in 1820, and George IV a few days before
his coronation in July, 1821. Sir Walter Scott’s figure
in Highland costume was taken from life in Edinburgh
in 1828, a year after George Canning’s likeness
had been similarly obtained.</p>

<p>It was in 1828 that Madame Tussaud took a portrait
of the miscreant Burke, immediately after his execution;
and she modelled from life his accomplice,
Hare, while he was in prison in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Prince Talleyrand’s figure was modelled from life
by Madame in 1832, Lord Eldon in 1833, the Duke
of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel in 1835, and Lord
Melbourne in 1836.</p>

<p>In that year Madame Tussaud took from life a
model of the Duchess of Kent, the mother of Queen
Victoria, which proved a great attraction. By this
time the Exhibition had found a home in Baker Street,
where it became established in the spring of 1835.</p>

<p>Concerning the travels of the Exhibition, it is on
record that Madame Tussaud visited North Shields
on the 2nd of December, 1811, and Edinburgh in
1811-12. Early in the latter year we find her on
the 28th of February at “4 The Market Place, Hull,
just opposite the Reindeer Inn.” She was in Leeds on
the 28th of September, and in Manchester on the 2nd
of December, 1812. There is an entry in an old account-book
which says, “Left the house in Criggate,
Leeds, Monday, November 16.” It is pretty clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that the Exhibition was located in Newcastle in January,
and in Liverpool on the 13th of April, 1813.</p>

<p>In 1817 the Exhibition was shown at “Mr. Sparrow’s
Upper Ware Rooms, Old Butter Market, Ipswich,
having lately arrived from the Concert Rooms,
Canterbury, and lastly from the Assembly Rooms,
Deal.”</p>

<p>It was probably when the Exhibition was visiting
Cambridge in 1818 that a worthy Don made the suggestion
that the figures of criminals should be placed in
a separate room. Too long would be taken even to
name all the places that were visited by the Exhibition,
but there is an account in the <cite>Coventry Herald</cite> that on
the 14th March, 1823, the cordial thanks of a meeting
of school managers were presented to Madame Tussaud
for her “unsolicited and handsome donation of a
moiety of the receipts of her Exhibition on Monday
evening last.”</p>

<p>Among the figures taken on tour at this time were
models of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the
Dauphin, Voltaire, and Madame St. Amaranthe (Tussaud’s
“Sleeping Beauty”), taken a few months before
her execution. These identical figures, as already
stated, are still in the collection.</p>

<p>To trace the travels of the Exhibition there is no
need. For some years Madame, with her sons, Joseph
and Francis, went on tour throughout the country. A
misadventure in the Irish Channel, when she was on
her way to Dublin, threatened the enterprise with disaster.
The vessel which carried their precious belongings
was partially wrecked, and many valuable exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were lost. Undaunted by the bufferings of Fate,
and helped by friends, Madame replenished her Exhibition
and brought it up to date.</p>

<p>The current of events did not run smoothly for
Madame Tussaud; but the little woman possessed a
brave spirit, and struggled on against adversity, being
upheld by the conviction that she would eventually
triumph.</p>

<p>The Bristol riots&mdash;Narrow escape of the Exhibition&mdash;A brave black
servant&mdash;Arrival at Blackheath.</p>

</div>

<p>The Bristol riots in the autumn of 1831 again
brought the Exhibition into serious jeopardy.
Madame Tussaud had just arrived in the city of the
West Country, when the Recorder, Sir Charles Wetherell,
came to open a Special Commission for the trial
of certain political offenders associated with the agitation
for reform. Judge Wetherell was heartily disliked
by West-country folk, and there was strong
opposition to this Special Commission being held. Public
resentment developed into a riot, which the military
was sent to subdue.</p>

<p class="caption">SIR CHARLES WETHERELL</p>

<p class="captionsub">Judge at the political trial that precipitated the Bristol riots.</p>

</div>

<p>Madame tells the story herself of the sufferings
she endured during the days of wanton destruction
and loss of life, as the rabble resorted to killing and
pillage. Judge Wetherell was obliged to escape from
the city, disguising himself, as it was then stated, with
some taunt at his personal habits, “through the medium
of a wash and the donning of a clean shirt and collar.”</p>

<p>The three days’ terror can scarcely be considered the
result of a genuine revolutionary movement. True,
certain ringleaders of the rabble seem to have imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in some vague way that they were hastening the day
of “liberty”; but the rioters only destroyed for sheer
destruction’s sake. What they sought to promote they
neither knew nor cared. For the most part the mob
was utterly contemptible, and but for the extraordinary
apathy of the authorities the riot might have
been easily quelled.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of Saturday, the 29th of
October, that the Recorder came to the city, and, a
disturbance being feared, a number of special constables
were sworn in. These officials, mostly young
men, did more harm than good, for they irritated the
people by overmuch zeal, and led to blows being exchanged,
which fomented the trouble. This was followed
by an attack on the Mansion House, where Sir
Charles was banqueting with the Corporation.</p>

<p>The civic party was hunted out, and made its escape
over the housetops. Suddenly the cry was raised, “To
the back!” and the mob surged round to the offices
behind the Mansion House, where faggots and firewood
were stored. For the present the rioters refrained
from firing the building, and contented themselves with
looting the premises. The cellars proved particularly
attractive to the unruly crowd, which was shortly in
possession of a hundred dozen of wine, and the day
closed amid general drunkenness and disorder.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the mob reassembled in Queen
Square. The authorities had plucked up sufficient
courage to publish a proclamation warning all rioters
to return to their homes; but these gentlemen were not
disposed to take the admonition seriously. The unlucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
bill-sticker who posted the proclamation was
badly mauled.</p>

<p>One individual mounted King William’s statue in
the Square and waved a tri-coloured cap on a pole,
shouting to his comrades to behold the cap of Liberty.
Possibly this aroused in the minds of the befuddled
rioters some recollection of the French Revolution, for
a move was made towards the gaol, which was speedily
in their power. A vigorous employment of sledgehammers
soon broke in the prison doors, and the prisoners,
some of them almost nude, at once joined the
mob.</p>

<p>The Governor’s house was sacked and fired; his
books were pitched into the New River, and the prison
van met with a similar fate. Then the Gloucester
County Gaol, the lock-up house at Lawford’s Gate,
and the Bishop’s Palace were all fired. Between seven
and eight o’clock the rioters revisited the cellars of the
Mansion House and began rolling out barrels of beer
and wine. Intoxicated persons could be seen moving
about the kitchen and the banqueting-room with lighted
candles, and in less than two hours the building was
gutted.</p>

<p>Dwellings in Queen Square were sacked and fired,
until the whole mass was wrapped in flames. Such
was the remarkable lethargy of the householders that
a few mischievous boys made a house-to-house visitation,
gave the inmates half an hour’s notice to quit,
and at the expiration of that time coolly set fire to
the houses without molestation. The booty the rioters
seized was trifling. On the corpse of one boy, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sabred by a soldier, was found a curious collection of
spoil&mdash;a lady’s glove, some children’s books, and the
Custom House keys.</p>

<p>One curious incident happened when the contents
of fifty puncheons of rum gushed out of a bonded
warehouse and ran flowing down the street, setting fire
to a house at the other end.</p>

<p>The riots were quelled by the military on the Monday,
after many thousands of pounds’ worth of property
had been destroyed; and one of the results was
that four persons were hanged.</p>

<p>By what might almost be described as a stroke of
good fortune&mdash;inasmuch as it perpetuated the name of
Tussaud&mdash;there was in Bristol at that time a lad
of nineteen years, named William Muller, whose genius
as a painter gives Bristol just cause for pride to-day.
This gifted youth produced a series of wonderful
sketches of the “Bristol Revolution,” as it was then
called, in which he portrays the weird and striking
scenes of incendiarism in the city streets.</p>

<p>One of these sketches is now in our possession. It
shows Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition premises standing
out full and clear in the fiery glare, while the figures
and other articles are being hurriedly removed and
piled up in the roadway before the jeering mob. The
figures and decorations are easily recognised in the picture,
and many of them are still included in the Exhibition.</p>

<p>For no imaginable reason the premises occupied by
Madame Tussaud’s collection had been marked to be
burnt. A chalk sign was scrawled upon the door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the adjoining buildings, besmeared with petroleum, had
been already set on fire. In Madame’s employment
was a stalwart and loyal negro. This black servant
took up his position at the entrance to the Exhibition,
and threatened to kill with a blunderbuss the first man
who dared approach to harm the place.</p>

<p>The negro kept the mob at bay long enough, it
would seem, to save the building, for at eight o’clock
Madame’s anxiety was relieved when she heard, above
the wild yelling of the infuriated people, the distant
sounds of the drums and fifes of the 11th Infantry
Regiment, just then reaching the outskirts of the city.
The music that cheered her scared the plundering rabble
and stayed their depredations.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud came through all this in her
seventieth year, with twenty years of activity still
before her; and, after a long tour through provincial
towns, she took her Exhibition to Blackheath, on the
south-eastern side of London, attracted, no doubt, by
the fact that that place had become a fashionable resort
owing to the residence there, some years previously,
of Queen Caroline, the estranged wife of George IV.</p>

<p>An old placard now in our possession informs us
that at Blackheath the Exhibition was housed in
the Assembly Room at the Green Man Hotel. The
exact date when it left there is not known, but we do
know that it had previously found a temporary abode
in the Town Hall, Brighton.</p>

<p>There it was visited early in 1833 by members of
the Royal Family, then in residence at the Pavilion,
as is vouched for in the following quaint notice. The
placard we give in full, not only on account of its
quaint wording, but because it gives a good idea of
the Exhibition as it then existed:</p>

<p class="center">MADAME TUSSAUD AND SONS</p>

<p>Have the honor to announce that their entirely new Exhibition,
which has only to be seen to ensure its support and patronage,
justly entitling it to the appellation of the most popular Collection
in the Empire, is NOW OPEN as above mentioned,
and they trust the Public will not form their ideas of it
from anything of a similar description they may have seen in
this Metropolis or elsewhere&mdash;as in their peculiar art they
stand alone; a fact acknowledged by those that have made the
tour of Europe. They are induced to state this to guard
against the prejudice excited by a view of inferior Collections.
Madame Tussaud had the honor of being Artist to Her Royal
Highness Madame Elizabeth, was patronized by the late Royal
Family of France, by their Royal Highnesses the Duke and
Duchess of York, twice by the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, and lately at the Town Hall, Brighton, by Her
Royal Highness the Princess Augusta, His Royal Highness
Prince George, and by nearly the whole of the Royal Establishment.</p>

<p>Her Royal Highness, with that kindness which has ever
distinguished the Royal Family for the encouragement of the
Fine Arts, honored Madame Tussaud with the following
letter:</p>

<p>“Lady Mary Taylor is commanded by Her Royal Highness
the Princess Augusta to acquaint Madame Tussaud with Her
Royal Highness’s approbation of her Exhibition, which is well
worthy of admiration, and the view of which afforded Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Royal Highness much amusement and gratification.&mdash;Pavilion,
Brighton, Feb. 9, 1833.”</p>

</div>

<p>The placard goes on to describe the Exhibition as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Exhibition consists of a great variety of Public Characters,
modelled with the greatest care, and regardless of expense,
among whom will be noticed the original figures of
<span class="smcapuc">BURKE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">HARE</span> (taken from their faces, to obtain which
the Proprietors went expressly to Scotland); which have excited
intense interest from the peculiar nature of their crimes,
and their approach to life, which renders it difficult to recognize
them from living persons. Also <span class="smcapuc">DENNIS COLLINS</span>
(taken from life at the gaol, Reading), in the identical dress
he had on when he made the atrocious attempt on His Majesty’s
life at Ascot Heath Races.</p>

</div>

<p>This shows that Madame Tussaud in those days, as
her successors do in these, took the greatest pains to
ensure fidelity as regards costume as well as features.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Madame Tussaud actually
originated the promenade concerts which have since
become so popular a form of musical entertainment,
for the placard goes on to announce that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There will be a Musical Promenade every Evening from
Half-past Seven till Ten, when a selection of Music will be
performed by the Messrs. Tussaud and Fishers; the Promenade
will be lighted with a profusion of lamps, producing,
with the variety of rich costumes, special decorations, etc., an
unequalled <i lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>.</p>

<p>A description is next given of some of the exhibits,
which will be perused with interest:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Collection consists of PORTRAITS in composition
as large as life, dressed in appropriate costumes.</p>

<p class="center">FIRST GROUP.</p>

<p class="center">REPRESENTING THE CORONATION OF H.M. WILLIAM IV.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;It represents <span class="smcapuc">HIS MAJESTY</span> on the Throne,

<p class="center">THE CORONATION OF BUONAPARTE,</p>

<p class="center">Copied from the Celebrated Picture by David.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The moment chosen is the time when Buonaparte,
contrary to all precedent crowned himself. It represents
him in the act of placing the Crown on his head, dressed
in the magnificent costume as worn by him at his Coronation;
also a Figure of the Empress Josephine, who is seen kneeling
at the foot of the altar, accompanied by a Page. At the altar
is represented His Holiness Pope Pius VI, giving the benediction,
supported by the celebrated Cardinal Fesche (Buonaparte’s
Uncle) and Prince Roustan (Buonaparte’s favourite
Mameluke) in the act of proclaiming the ceremony, attended
by a Mameluke.</p>

<p>The two above-mentioned Groups have been universally
admired by every one that has seen them; and Madame Tussaud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and Sons hope they will meet with the approbation of
the Inhabitants of London and its Vicinity.</p>

to the Public, have endeavoured to blend utility and amusement.
It contains an outline of the history of each character
represented in the Exhibition, which will not only greatly increase
the pleasure to be derived from a mere view of the
figures, but will also convey to the minds of young persons
much biographical knowledge, a branch of education universally
allowed to be one of the highest importance.</p>

<p>The following highly interesting figures and objects, in
consequence of the Peculiarity of their appearance, are placed
in an adjoining situation, and are well worth the attention of
artists and amateurs, taken by order of the National Assembly
by Madame Tussaud&mdash;The Celebrated John Marat, one of
the leaders of the French Revolution, taken immediately after
his assassination by Charlotte Corde. The following heads&mdash;Robespierre,

<p class="center">REMOVAL POSTPONED TILL FURTHER NOTICE.</p>

<p>The Flattering Success with which this Exhibition continues
to be honored, (the Promenade being Crowded every Evening),
the very general desire expressed by Thousands for it to remain
some time longer, (its merits becoming more generally
known), being acknowledged to be the most Splendid, and, at
the same time, the most Instructive to Youth, (induces the
Proprietors to obey the general wish.) It will remain in consequence
till further Notice.</p>

<p>The Exhibition is, therefore, located in “The Great
Assembly Room of the late Royal London Bazaar,
Gray’s Inn Road.” There it remained till early in
March, 1835, on the 21st of which month it removed
to its quarters in Baker Street.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that one of the first visitors
to the Exhibition in its settled home at Baker Street
was the great Duke of Wellington. He was there on
Wednesday, the 26th of August, and after that date
was frequently to be seen walking through the rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his favourite models being those of Queen Victoria and
the dead Napoleon.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Duke requested Mr. Joseph Tussaud,
the elder son of Madame Tussaud, to let him know
whenever a new figure of exceptional interest was
added to the Exhibition&mdash;<em>not forgetting the Chamber
of Horrors</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;" id="illus32">

<p class="caption">JOSEPH TUSSAUD</p>

<p class="captionsub">Elder son of Madame Tussaud, born 1796, died 1864.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Tussaud ventured a remark expressing his surprise
that the Duke should be interested in such figures,
whereupon the old warrior turned upon him with
the rejoinder, “Well, do they not represent <em>fact</em>?”</p>

<p>Other models added about this time included those
of Nicholas I of Russia, Louis Philippe, King of the
French, the Duke of Cumberland, Talleyrand, and
Hume, the historian.</p>

<p>A tragic occurrence took place shortly after the Exhibition
had taken up its abode in London, and led
to its permanent establishment in the Metropolis. At
that time Madame de Malibran, the eldest daughter
of the Spanish singer, Manuel Garcia, was idolised
by the populace as a gifted songstress. She died suddenly
during a festival held at Manchester on the
23rd of September, 1836, in the twenty-eighth year
of her age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;" id="illus31">

<p class="caption">MADAME MARIE FELICITA DE MALIBRAN</p>

<p class="captionsub">Famous opera singer, daughter of the Spanish singer, Manual
Garcia, made her début in London in 1825 and after a successful
European tour reached New York, when she married a local
French merchant, M. Malibran, after his bankruptcy returning to
the stage and greater honors.</p>

</div>

<p>Madame Tussaud placed her figure in the Exhibition
with all speed, and the numerous admirers of the
<i lang="it">prima donna</i> flocked to see it. The idea there and
then took hold of Madame Tussaud’s mind that the
Exhibition would command perennial success by being
constantly brought up to date through the adding of
the portraits of people whose names were on everybody’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
lips. This principle has been faithfully observed
ever since.</p>

<p>In the early days at Baker Street “the Hours of
Exhibition,” as the Catalogue quaintly puts it, were
“from 11 in the Morning till 5, and from 7 in the
Evening till 10. Brilliantly illuminated at 8.” When
the place was closed, seats were provided in the vestibule,
and it was no uncommon sight to see from fifty to
a hundred persons waiting for the reopening of the
doors at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>How the Waterloo carriage was acquired&mdash;A chance conversation on
London Bridge&mdash;The strange adventures of an Emperor’s equipage&mdash;Affidavit
of Napoleon’s coachman.</p>

</div>

<p>The account of how we became possessed of the
Waterloo carriage reads like an interesting chapter
from fiction.</p>

<p>In the collection are two other Napoleon vehicles,
namely, the Milan and St. Helena carriages. They
are all strongly built, ponderous, and suitable for a
great campaigner.</p>

<p class="caption">NAPOLEON’S MILITARY CARRIAGE,
CAPTURED ON THE RETREAT
FROM WATERLOO</p>

<p class="captionsub">This was discovered by Mr. Joseph
Tussaud in London in 1842 and purchased
for the Tussaud collection.</p>

</div>

<p>But what we are particularly concerned to tell at
this moment is the story of the strange coincidence by
which the Waterloo carriage was secured for the Exhibition.
In all the wonderful happenings associated
with this place, possibly none is quite so simple and yet
so surprising as this. Mr. Joseph Tussaud, the elder
son of Madame Tussaud, was a great lover of London,
and it was his delight to roam leisurely about the
Metropolis, studying the streets and byways and the
people who traversed them.</p>

<p>In one of these peregrinations during the spring of
1842 he found himself leaning over the parapet of
London Bridge, watching the movements of the diversified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
craft on the river, when he observed by the wharves
of Billingsgate a carriage being hoisted ashore from
the deck of a ship like a huge spider hanging from its
web.</p>

<p>That in itself was probably a fairly frequent occurrence,
and it would have passed from Mr. Tussaud’s
memory except for what followed. There were numbers
of people looking over the bridge&mdash;as may be seen
to-day, and will be seen for many a day to come&mdash;and
my great-uncle suddenly heard the voice of a countryman
next to him saying, “That’s a very fine carriage,
but I know where there’s a finer that some people would
give a lot to have. I could take you to a place where
you could see the selfsame carriage in which Napoleon
tried to escape from Waterloo.”</p>

<p>This was news indeed to a Tussaud&mdash;the one man
in all London to whom it mattered most&mdash;and it may
be imagined that the countryman was encouraged to
go on with his story and show the way to the coveted
relic. The carriage, which has since been of inestimable
value to Madame Tussaud’s, was traced to a repository
in Gray’s Inn Road, belonging to one Robert
Jeffreys, “a respectable coach manufacturer, who took
the carriage in part payment of a bad debt,” as explained
in a contemporary news-sheet. Did ever time
play a trick like that with the carriage of an Emperor?
“In part payment of a bad debt!” Who the debtor
was, there is no telling now; it is, however, known that
the carriage had been bought at a Tattersall auction,
when short-sighted speculators let Napoleon’s chariot
go cheap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Previously the carriage had earned a fortune for Mr.
William Bullock, who took it round the country as an
exhibit, which the people flocked in their thousands to
see, till the novelty wore off and the carriage was rolled
into the repository of Jeffreys, the coach-builder, where
it remained for years with none to do it reverence. An
early cartoon by Cruikshank, in November of the Waterloo
year, portrays a clamorous crowd surrounding the
carriage when on view at the Egyptian Hall, and, it
must be admitted, treating it with scant respect.</p>

<p>The carriage had been sent as a present to George
IV when Prince Regent, and in due time it arrived at
Carlton House with four high-stepping Normandy
horses. <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> of March, 1817, states
that “Bonaparte’s military carriage has excited more interest
as an exhibit than anything for a number of
years.” The manner in which the four horses were
driven through the city by the French coachman, Jean
Hornn, who lost his right arm when the carriage was
captured, proves the excellent manner in which the
horses were broken in. Mr. Bullock, in whose hands
this splendid trophy of victory was placed by the Government,
is said to have cleared £26,000 by his exhibition
of it.</p>

<p>There is a letter in existence by Mr. William Bullock
in which he states that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… the celebrated Carriage, taken by the Prussian
troops about fifteen miles from Waterloo on the evening
of the great Battle, was afterwards purchased by
me from his late Majesty George IV for the sum of
£2,500, and exhibited by me at the Egyptian Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Piccadilly, London, as well as in the principal Cities
in Great Britain and Ireland, by the Authority of the
Government, and is the identical carriage I have just
seen in your possession. The Diamonds found in the
Carriage … were purchased by Mr. Mawe, diamond
merchant in the Strand, from Baron Von Keller, the
Officer that captured them. The present one, with
others, was purchased by me from Mr. Mawe.</p>

<p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your most obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Bullock</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not known what Mr. Joseph Tussaud paid Mr.
Robert Jeffreys, the Gray’s Inn Road coach-builder,
for it; but this much may be said, that the carriage
which proved so good an investment for Mr. Bullock
has fulfilled all expectations at Madame Tussaud’s,
where it is pre-eminently the right thing in the right
place.</p>

<p>It was certified at the time that M. Simon, of
Brussels, built the carriage, and that most of the contrivances
for economising space and ensuring comfort
and convenience were suggested by the Emperor himself
and his second wife, Marie Louise; also that this
was the carriage which picked up Napoleon on his retreat
to Paris after the burning of Moscow.</p>

<p>Scarcely less singular than the coincidence of my
great-uncle meeting with the countryman on London
Bridge was my acquiring, sixteen years ago, from a
second-hand bookseller in Margate, an original official
letter relating to the carriage. The letter, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
seen, bears a date about five months after the Battle
of Waterloo. It reads:</p>

till further notice.</p>

</div>

<p>The following affidavit sworn by Jean Hornn at the
Mansion House before the famous Lord Mayor, Sir
Matthew Wood, on the 9th of March, 1816, is of peculiar
interest, containing as it does several important
historic details:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">AFFIDAVIT OF JEAN HORNN.</p>

<p>JEAN HORNN, a native of Bergen-op-Zoom in Holland,
and now of Piccadilly in the County of Middlesex, aged
twenty-eight years, maketh oath:&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT about ten years ago he entered into the service of
Napoleon Bonaparte, the late Emperor of France, and attended
Napoleon in the capacity of his military coachman, through
the campaign which was distinguished by the battle of Jena&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT he attended Napoleon, in the same capacity of military
coachman, during the subsequent campaigns, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
greater part of Prussia, Spain, Germany, and Russia, and in
his excursion to Italy&mdash;</p>

<p>AND this Deponent saith, that he drove the military Carriage
of the said Ex-Emperor from Paris to Waterloo; in
which Carriage the Emperor travelled thither, accompanied by
General Bertrand&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT on the evening of the day on which the battle of
Waterloo was fought, he, this Deponent, was attacked while
with the said Carriage, by a detachment of Prussian lancers,
and other infantry, who captured the Carriage, together with
the Necessaire, and other articles it contained for the personal
use of the Ex-Emperor&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT whilst this Deponent was remaining with the Carriage,
in a field about thirty paces from the road, endeavouring
to pass round Jenappe (which was blocked up in the confusion
of the retreat) he, this Deponent received ten wounds in
various parts of the body; three of which were in his right
arm&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT having then no appearance of life, he was left
among the dead&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT a few days afterwards, and whilst this Deponent
was lying in great agony at Jenappe, he was removed by a
British officer; who conveyed him to Brussels, and who obtained
the amputation of this Deponent’s arm, as well as
surgical care of his other wounds&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT he afterwards returned to Paris; and has received
from the present Government of France a small annual pension&mdash;</p>

<p>AND this Deponent saith, that he hath inspected the Carriage,
Horses, Necessaire of Gold and Silver, their respective
Cases, the Pistols, Wearing Apparel, and other Articles now
exhibiting at the London Museum, in Piccadilly (and which
this Deponent hath been informed have been received there
from the British Government), and that they are the same
Carriage, Horses, Necessaire, and other Articles which belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to the late Emperor of France, and were personally used by
him&mdash;</p>

<p>AND that the Carriage is the same in which the Ex-Emperor
proceeded to Moscow; and which Carriage was driven by this
Deponent, with the Ex-Emperor therein, twenty-four leagues
beyond that City, on the road to Chotillowo&mdash;</p>

<p>THAT after the French army evacuated Moscow, and in
the retreat toward France, the same Carriage was removed
from off the perch and wheels, and placed on a sledge, and
that the Ex-Emperor travelled therein, and was driven by this
Deponent&mdash;</p>

<p>AND this Deponent also saith, that he hath seen and
examined the Grey Surtout Coat, lined with Sable Fur, which
is also at the London Museum; and that it is the same which
this Deponent hath frequently seen worn by the said Ex-Emperor
during the Russian campaign; and that the parts of
the coat which appear to have been burnt and scorched were
chiefly so burnt and scorched by the fires, before which it was
frequently placed during that campaign&mdash;</p>

<p>AND this Deponent saith, that the Fur Travelling Cap, and
the several other Articles of Wearing Apparel (exclusive of
those which came from the British Government, and which
are also at the London Museum) were parts of the personal
Wardrobe of the Ex-Emperor of France; and were frequently
used and worn by him&mdash;</p>

<p>AND this Deponent was present when the said Surtout Coat,
Travelling Cap, and other last-mentioned Articles were purchased
by Mr. Bullock, at Paris, of Guste Maitrot, who was
keeper of the Wardrobe to the late Emperor of France.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jean Hornn.</span></p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Napoleon’s Waterloo carriage&mdash;Description of its exterior.</p>

</div>

<p>Some account must be given of this most interesting
relic.</p>

<p>Ever since it first came to the Exhibition it has excited
the most lively interest, and, until it was covered
in by a glazed case, visitors enjoyed the privilege
of sitting inside&mdash;a proceeding which would not have
mattered had not unscrupulous souvenir hunters abused
this favour by pilfering portions of the fabric that
lined it.</p>

<p>Time-worn, it now stands before us, a thing of gaunt
and sombre aspect. This old war-coach offers, to those
who contemplate it, a full measure of historic reminiscence,
recalling the most striking and critical episodes
in the great Corsican’s career.</p>

<p>He entered it at the time his power stood at its
zenith, and retained it in constant attendance upon him
down to the hour he took refuge within it, a conquered
and a broken man. It was built for his campaign in
Russia. In it he travelled many a league on the road
to Moscow. Bereft of its wheels and lashed upon a
sleigh, through the perils of that terrible retreat, it
safely carried him far on his way back to the gates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Paris. With him it was sent to the Isle of Elba; thence
it helped him along on his last auspicious journey to
the French capital.</p>

<p class="caption">NAPOLEON’S MILITARY CARRIAGE</p>

<p class="captionsub">Scene of its capture at Jenappe. From a colored
engraving published during the autumn
of 1815.</p>

</div>

<p>It assisted him on his way to Waterloo. Standing
on the main road hard by La Belle Alliance, it waited
him throughout that memorable Sunday, the 18th of
June, over a hundred years ago. At the end of the
day’s ordeal into it, sore and ill, he flung himself, only
to struggle from it at the point of capture to take
refuge in the confusion and the shadow of the night,
leaving his hat, sword, and many other things behind
him.</p>

<p>Deepened long ago into a monotone of dusky grey,
still here and there the old coach betrays a touch of
colour, revealing a fair estimate of its former self.
Simple and modest as Imperial carriages go, nevertheless,
on a certain May day in the year 1812, as it sallied
forth on its maiden voyage, its back turned upon the
old Palace of St. Cloud and its fore-carriage set upon
the highroad to Russia, it must have looked a comely
chariot&mdash;as yet unsullied by the stain of travel, and
not yet degraded by the lust of war.</p>

<p>By the man that made it&mdash;one Simon, of Brussels,
to whom reference has already been made&mdash;it would
have been designated a <i lang="fr">berline de voyage</i>, or maybe a
<i lang="fr">carrosse a six chevaux</i>, by us it has been called a travelling
carriage, and technically classed as a chariot-built
coach.</p>

<p>Dark-blue, black, and yellow, with here and there a
line of red and gold, were the colours under which it
made its début.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The head, or upper part of the body, is constructed
of thick black-enamelled leather, stretching over a
strong framework of ash. The lower portion consists
of finely polished wood panelling, originally of a rich
dark-blue colour. A narrow brass fillet traverses the
centre of the body, lining off its upper from its lower
sections, and under this fillet runs a delicate gilt scroll
composed of the fruit, leaf, and tendrils of the vine.
This neat and unpretentious bordering, together with
the emblazonment of the Imperial arms upon the doors,
constitutes the only tangible claim the carriage has to
anything in the nature of artistic adornment.</p>

<p>A curious bulkhead, or boot, built out from the fore-part
of the coach, provides, among other things, the
very important accommodation contingent upon a long
and unbroken journey&mdash;the opportunity of resting at
full length within it.</p>

<p>Under this bulkhead Napoleon’s camp bedstead still
reposes, neatly encased within a receptacle some six
inches square and three feet long, folded, ready to be
withdrawn at a moment’s notice. When and where
this bedstead was last required for its master’s use are
points of interest often conjectured, but as yet not
satisfied.</p>

<p>Placed beyond the bulkhead, unusually forward and
high above the fore-wheels, is perched the coachman’s
dicky&mdash;a dicky on which the coachman must have sat
alone, for its size excludes any chance of companionship.
It is supported by slender scroll iron stays in
a manner so mobile, so sensitive to the slightest movement,
that the poor jehu who piloted the coach through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
those long and weary journeys we know it to have traversed
must at times have felt sorely tempted to guide
his horses from their prescribed course and to steer
them away into the “Land of Nod.”</p>

<p>The doors possess the simple distinction of opening
in the opposite direction from those of an ordinary
English carriage, whilst the Imperial arms&mdash;a device
borrowed of the Cæsars&mdash;are still to be clearly deciphered
upon both panels.</p>

<p>The ponderous under-carriage might well suggest to
the mind of a mechanic an instance in which weight
had far outbidden advantage in strength. The heavy,
split, crane-neck perch, the deep solid axle-bed, and
the cumbersome fore-carriage have been constructed
throughout in wrought iron, and afford a good example
of the coachsmith’s work of a century ago. The great
cee springs are in keeping with the rest, heavy and
strong. The thick leather straps plying them, and
carrying the full weight of the body of the carriage
and all contained within it, are still in sound condition
and quite capable of doing their work; but by
way of precaution they have now been relieved of all
strain, and the weight is borne by four iron standards
springing directly from the floor.</p>

<p>The wheels, even compared with others of the period
in which they were made, are very heavily dished.
Following the Continental manner, the spokes are arranged
in pairs, so that their spacing out might be
described as two close together and two wide apart&mdash;those
placed near together entering the rim near where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the felloes join, presumably with the object of adding
strength at a weak point.</p>

<p>The rims are made up of seven felloes fixed together
with iron clamps. The iron tyres, heavy and
rough, are secured to the rims with bolts and nuts,
instead of, as in our day, by rivets and burrs. The
hubs, or stocks, large and massive, are further strengthened
by stock hoops, the flange on the outer hoops of
the fore-wheels being hexagonal, while those on the
hind-wheels are of a plain round shape.</p>

<p>The axles are curiously primitive&mdash;simple nut-axles
used from time immemorial&mdash;the wheels being held in
position by means of strong rough iron nuts screwed
on at the extremity of the axle arms and further secured
by a pin passed through a hole at the end of them.
Strangely enough, the axle-ends are absolutely devoid
of caps.</p>

<p>Behind on the foot-stage, or rumble, there still rests,
as on the day the vehicle was taken, the odd-looking
and spacious shoe-shaped trunk in which so many articles
of apparel belonging to Napoleon were found.
This is doubtless the source from which have flowed
during the past century not a few genuine, but also
numberless doubtful, belongings attributed to the great
Napoleon which have been offered for sale under the
“incontestable” sworn testimony of so many irresponsible
and illusive authorities as having been found in
Napoleon’s carriage captured at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The four black square metal lamps fixed in a rough-and-ready
way with iron rods to the corners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
coach have a simple and quaint appearance, but otherwise
have little about them to call for comment. They
have been made to take large wax candles, and have
the usual spring sockets to hold them.</p>

<p>Description of the Waterloo carriage (<i>continued</i>)&mdash;Its interior and
peculiar contrivances&mdash;Brought to England and exhibited at the
London Museum.</p>

<p class="caption">NAPOLEON’S MILITARY CARRIAGE</p>

<p class="captionsub">The interior.</p>

</div>

<p>The interior of the carriage is even more interesting
than the exterior. Glancing within, we immediately
find ourselves in closer touch with things
personal to the great Emperor.</p>

<p>We find therein provision for a couple of passengers
only. Here are two deep and roomy seats, divided
by a tall movable arm-rest, offering the occupants unusual
freedom and comfort. Confronting these seats,
set high up on the front of the vehicle, are a pair of
windows affording each traveller a full view of the
driver and of the road and country beyond. Beneath
these are displayed those objects of interest which
have so readily engrossed the attention of many millions
of visitors who, during the century past, have
been moved to inspect the carriage.</p>

<p>Opposite to that seat usually occupied by Napoleon&mdash;that
is to say, the one on the offside, following our
rule of the road&mdash;there hangs a brass handle which is
apparently attached merely to a simple shallow drawer.
An easy pull at this reveals a strong and well-appointed
writing-desk, capable of being withdrawn far out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
its recess. This action, with the aid of a writing-slope
that unfolds from the top, enables the desk to span
the space between the front of the carriage and the seat,
thus giving to its occupant all the facility and convenience
desirable for carrying on a correspondence at
leisure.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only accommodation the desk provides.
Some time after the carriage had changed ownership
it was found that an extra pull withdrew the
desk still farther from its aperture, and upon this being
done a secret compartment was discovered behind
it, in which were found jewels and money of great
value.</p>

<p>On the right side of this desk, fitted into a narrow
but deep recess, there rests a long, wedge-shaped box
made to hold a goodly supply of those quills of which
Napoleon was so uncommonly prodigal.</p>

<p>Below these fittings, and readily engaging attention,
is a large cloth-covered door, hinged to open towards
the middle of the carriage, so that when butting against
the arm-rest of the seat it divides the lower portion of
the interior into two separate parts. When so placed
it exposes a large cavity constituting the lower part
or foot of a sleeping compartment, the seat of the coach
serving for the head, and the space between being
bridged by a plank or board. In this cavity were found
all the necessary things for making up a complete and
comfortable bed.</p>

<p>On the near side of the front interior, placed immediately
under the window, is a shallow rack made
to take small things such as sealing-wax, wafers, paper-knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
etc., the receptacle being furnished with a wooden
flap and catch to enclose it. Underneath this is a large
and strongly made drawer that pulls out endways.
In it many things were discovered which were in immediate
use before the capture of the coach, among
them several pieces of a silver service containing articles
of food remaining from a meal.</p>

<p>Below this again there is an opening, which has
never boasted of a door to enclose it. At the bottom
of it a brass-bound rest, or table, has been fitted between
grooves so that it may be drawn out, or pushed
in, as occasion required. This also forms a bridge
to unite the recess with the seat facing it, so as to
provide a second sleeping compartment when found
necessary.</p>

<p>On the inside of the doors hang heavy cloth lapels
covering large square pockets, edged with broad gold-coloured
gimp braid speckled with blue spots. On the
outer side of each seat is a deep hole, both of which
contained a loaded pistol ready at hand in case of
emergency.</p>

<p>Well above and running across the back of the seats
is a half-circle recess serving as a gun-rack, forming a
strange protrusion viewed from the outside of the
coach.</p>

<p>An oil lamp, which at best could have yielded but
a feeble light, takes up the customary position in the
centre at the back of the carriage.</p>

<p>The interior is lined throughout with a dark-blue
cloth, in colour and texture similar to that used at the
present day for the same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>A fairly reliable inventory of things found in the
carriage on the night it was captured has been handed
down to us, and the following is a copy:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A beautifully constructed and marvellously well-appointed
<i lang="fr">nécessaire</i>, comprising some seventy pieces, a
few in solid gold and many mounted in the same metal
(a present from Marie Louise to Napoleon on the eve
of his departure for the Russian campaign of 1812, and
designed and carried out under her immediate supervision).</p>

<p>Several parts of a solid silver service, engraved with
the Imperial arms.</p>

<p>A large silver chronometer.</p>

<p>A green velvet cap.</p>

<p>A mahogany liquor case, containing two leather-covered
bottles, one filled with rum and the other holding
a small quantity of sweet wine.</p>

found carefully put by in the secret drawer at the back

a friend, or one possibly that endangered Napoleon’s
own life.</p>

<p>The jewels and other articles easy of acquisition
fell, for the most part, to the lot of Major von Keller’s
men of the 15th Prussian Infantry Regiment of the
Line, which was that night under the command of General
Count Gneisenau.</p>

<p>The coach was drawn by a team of six of the finest
brown Normandy horses, four driven by the coachman,
the leaders under the control of a postilion.</p>

<p>When the coach was overtaken by the Prussians&mdash;that
is to say, about a quarter-past eleven at night,
outside the town of Jenappe&mdash;the postilion and the
leaders were killed outright, whilst the coachman,
severely wounded, was left for dead upon the road.
Recovering from his many wounds&mdash;one of which entailed
the loss of his right arm&mdash;he was induced by
Major von Keller himself to come over to this country
with the coach and horses. These were exhibited,
as a very special attraction for the Christmas holidays
of 1815, at the London Museum (then but recently
opened by Mr. Bullock) in Piccadilly, a house of entertainment
that was soon to be known to future generations
as the Egyptian Hall.</p>

<p>And now for a century has this old war-coach been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
held up for the inspection of the passer-by, and, in its
turn, has been the dumb witness of many a fleeting
and touching episode. For as it stood have not time
and men passed on? Has it not beheld many a young
gallant, with the honours of the campaign fresh upon
him, recounting to wife and child the story of that last
great battle that closed the Empire of the first Napoleon;
many a veteran son of Mars telling his grown
sons how that great day was won; many a kindly warrior
gently helping his children’s children to mount
the steps and learn how on that day old “Boney” was
made to fly, and nearly got caught in the act?</p>

<p>But those to whom the old coach must have brought
back so many vivid memories of that famous victory,
and who had the greatest right to enter it, have themselves
moved on; and now its doors have been fastened
up and the old chariot encased for secure keeping, not
indeed against the ravages of time, but, with regret it
must be said, safe away from the hands of those who
would not scruple to despoil it.</p>

<p class="caption">NAPOLEON’S BAROUCHE</p>

<p class="captionsub">The carriage used by Bonaparte during his exile at St. Helena.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the last carriage in which Napoleon is
known to have ridden.</p>

<p>On his first arrival at St. Helena he took much exercise
in the saddle, but during and after the year 1818,
until he ceased venturing beyond the precincts of Longwood,
he made constant use of this vehicle.</p>

<p>The following extract from Mr. Norwood Young’s
very valuable contribution to our Napoleonic literature,
<cite>Napoleon in Exile at St. Helena</cite>, gives us an
insight to the manner in which it was used:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>After the dictation and the reading, Napoleon, in
the afternoon, generally went for a drive, one of the
ladies, with Bertrand or Las Cases, being taken in the
carriage. The two Archambauds at first used six
horses, afterwards reduced to four, which they drove,
as postilions, at a great pace. The round of the wood,
done at high speed, was soon covered, and the course
would then be repeated. Madame de Montholon declared
that they went so fast that it was difficult to
breathe. At this rate the wood was so often driven
round that, in spite of the excitement of dodging the
trees, there came a staleness in the sport. In the early
days the outing would be varied by a visit to the Bertrands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
at Hutt’s Gate, and all the ladies became much
alarmed as the vehicle dashed round the corners, with
the terrible precipice on one side. It was indeed dangerous,
for there were no barriers, and a little carelessness
might have sent the whole party down the abyss.
There is now in most places a low earth bank, a railing
made of gas-pipes, and a plantation of flax at the edge,
which at least conceals the danger.</p>

<p>When the Bertrands had moved from Hutt’s Gate
the drives never went beyond the Longwood estate,
which has a circuit of about four miles.</p>

</div>

<p>Who built the carriage and how it came to be transported
to St. Helena, we know not. In type it is what
was then&mdash;and for the matter of that is still&mdash;known
as a “barouche.”</p>

<p>Yellow and green are the prevailing colours in
which the body has been enamelled, the former predominating
to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Ponderously built throughout, as indeed were all
travelling carriages of this period, the body is swung
so that its full weight is cast upon the hind-wheels.</p>

<p>The under-carriage is strong and cumbersome, like
that of the Waterloo carriage, standing by its side. Its
heavy cee springs are overlaid by strong leather straps
upon which the body is comfortably slung. The carriage
is lined throughout with heavy green superfine
cloth.</p>

<p>So far as its general appearance is concerned, it
might well be designated as unexceptional. It has no
mark or devices upon it to indicate that it constituted
the equipage of a royal household, and the axle-caps
have not even the maker’s name upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The following quotations from an old Catalogue
published at the time when the conveyance was first
installed in our collection of Napoleonic relics remove
any doubt as to its authenticity:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>237. CARRIAGE used by the Emperor Napoleon,
during six years of his exile at St. Helena, and the
last he ever entered. Certified by the Counts Montholon
and Las Cases. The following is the letter,
with description, from Mr. Blofeld, of whom it was
purchased:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“In accordance with your request I send you the following
brief particulars of the carriage used by the
Emperor Napoleon at St. Helena. I purchased it in
1848, at that island, of Major Charles Sampson, an
officer who had lived highly respected there for more
than fifty years, and who gave me the following certificate:</p>

<p>“‘Received from Mr. John Blofeld, for Bonaparte’s
old carriage, the first used by him on the Island of St.

both said they had frequently rode in it with the Emperor,
and they most kindly gave me the following certificates,
which, as you purchased the carriage, I enclose.
General Montholon informed me that the Emperor
always used it, drawn by four horses, ridden by
two postilions, with the head of the carriage down.</p>

<p class="caption">FATHER MATHEW, “THE NOBLE PRIEST OF CORK”</p>

<p class="captionsub">A great temperance leader whose striking resemblance to Napoleon
I. caused an odd confusion in the Museum when in renovating the
wax figures a servant put the head of Father Mathew on the shoulders
of the deposed Emperor.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the greatest of all temperance reformers
was Father Mathew, “the Noble Priest of Cork,”
who persuaded sixty thousand people in London alone
to become teetotallers and to take a pledge to that
effect. The apostle of temperance was induced to come
to London in the early forties to give a series of lectures.</p>

<p>Some were delivered at Hall’s Riding School (now
a motor garage) in Albany Street, opposite Holy Trinity
Church and close to Great Portland Street Station,
and Mr. Francis Tussaud (grandfather of the
writer) modelled him in one of the rooms of that place.
He was constantly interrupted during the sittings by
people of all classes and creeds coming into take the
pledge. Most of them insisted upon kneeling to receive
Father Mathew’s blessing. They were probably
actuated by respect for him, and also by the hope that
the recollection of his blessing might strengthen their
teetotal vows.</p>

<p>At the close of the sittings Father Mathew detached
from his breast his temperance medal, which was attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to a ribbon round his neck, and handed it to
the artist that it might be placed upon his model.</p>

<p>Father Mathew bore so striking a resemblance in
face and figure to Napoleon I that the two were once
oddly mistaken for each other by our own servants.</p>

<p>We had occasion to renovate the portraits of the
soldier and the preacher. To do so it was necessary
that the heads of both should be detached. The assistant
who was responsible for taking the figures to
pieces in this way mistook the one head for the other.
The error was fortunately soon detected by Mr. Francis
Tussaud, who had modelled both the heads, and
he soon had the mistake rectified.</p>

<p>There are persons still living who remember Father
Mathew. An old and respected neighbour, Francis
Draper by name, is one of the youngest men of eighty-seven
one could possibly meet. Although born in 1832,
he still possesses a wonderfully clear memory.</p>

<p>In 1842, when Father Mathew paid his visit to
London, Mr. Draper&mdash;then a boy of ten years&mdash;was
introduced to him at the Riding School. In an anteroom
upstairs, to which Father Mathew retired between
the times when he administered the pledge, he
saw an artist modelling his face in clay, which he
was told was for Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition. He
had an impression at the time that the artist was Francis,
a son of Madame Tussaud, and his surmise was
accurate, for it was Mr. Francis Tussaud who was
executing the model.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>For many years afterwards he saw “The Noble
Priest of Cork” standing in a group in Madame Tussaud’s,
with his medal suspended round his neck, and,
he says, it was the best likeness of anyone in the rooms.</p>

<p>The assassination of Alexander II of Russia in
March, 1881, recalls a quaint story of Voltaire’s chair,
which stands in a corner of one of the Napoleon Rooms,
not far removed from a collection of heads of leaders
of the French Revolution.</p>

<p class="caption">VOLTAIRE’S CHAIR</p>

</div>

<p>This chair is one of our most treasured relics. It
was made to Voltaire’s own design, and is unlike any
other chair we have ever seen.</p>

<p>After the <i lang="fr">Entente Cordiale</i> between France and England
in the forties, the visit to Queen Victoria of Louis
Philippe was promptly followed by the arrival in London,
in 1844, of Alexander’s father, Nicholas I of Russia,
who, during his stay, was conducted over the Exhibition
by Madame Tussaud’s elder son, Joseph.</p>

<p>In the course of his tour round the galleries the
Tsar’s attention was arrested by the great Frenchman’s
wonderful chair. Being struck by its ingenious construction,
he examined it very closely, and then, as
so many persons have done, gave himself the pleasure
of occupying the seat in which the famous satirist had
spent many an industrious hour.</p>

<p>The chair was intended by Voltaire to facilitate
his literary work, and, evidently taking account of his
incessant labours, he had the arms extended without
supports so that he could sit in any attitude and facing
any direction, while a movable writing-slope was attached
to be always within his reach.</p>

<p>So keen an interest did the Tsar take in the chair
that we decided to make a replica and send it to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
as a pleasant surprise. This was done, but no direct
acknowledgment of the chair’s delivery was ever received.</p>

<p>Months afterwards, however, two cases&mdash;one containing
a splendid gallery portrait of Nicholas and the
other a beautiful statuette of the same monarch&mdash;arrived
at the Exhibition. These presents were accepted
as a recognition, in practical form, of the chair. They
could not have signified an Imperial bid for a place in
the Exhibition, for a most lifelike model of His Majesty
was already there.</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly forty years later, on the assassination of
Nicholas’s son, Alexander&mdash;to which allusion has been
made&mdash;there appeared in one of our leading English
illustrated papers, which gave pages to the story of the
assassination, a full double-page picture of the Imperial
study at St. Petersburg, and, behold, therein
stood the identical chair which we had sent to Nicholas
I.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that on Wednesday, the 20th
of October, thirty-six years later, a number of Princesses
came to the Exhibition; and among them was
Princess Alix of Hesse, then a happy young girl of
eight, and now mourned as the late Tsarina, who, as
reported, shared with the Tsar and his family a terrible
death at the hands of diabolical assassins during the
recent Russian Revolution. Among the royal party
which came on that day were our own Princesses Louise,
Victoria, and Maud of Wales.</p>

<p>A great Wesleyan preacher and lecturer in his day
was the Rev. Peter McKenzie, who died in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
1895. He deserves a place in these memoirs on account
of his characteristic and rather eccentric behaviour
when he visited the Exhibition. In the course
of his perambulation through the galleries he, like most
of our patrons, found his way to the Napoleon Rooms,
where Voltaire’s chair immediately arrested his attention.</p>

<p>Striking an indignant attitude in front of it, the
Wesleyan preacher exclaimed, “And this belonged to
the man that was going to pull down the edifice of
Christianity and sweep the religion of Jesus Christ
from the earth!” So saying, he planted himself in
the chair and, with a triumphant wave of his hand,
declaimed to the wondering visitors gathered round the
following verse of a well-known hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Landseer and the Count d’Orsay visit the Exhibition&mdash;A fright&mdash;Norfolk
farmer’s account of Queen Victoria’s visit.</p>

</div>

<p>About the year 1845 the celebrated Count d’Orsay,
being, as usual, in a desperate state of impecuniosity,
was absolutely afraid to venture out of
Gore House (where now stands the Royal Albert
Hall), except on Sunday, for fear of being arrested
and imprisoned for debt.</p>

<p>It so happened that a portrait of one of the members
of the Royal Family, painted by the Count, was
just then in process of engraving, and it was necessary
before the proofs could be struck off that d’Orsay himself
should see and correct the work of the engraver.
To do this the Count would be obliged to go to the
engraver’s house, and that gentleman, being of a devout
and Sabbatarian turn of mind, utterly refused to receive
d’Orsay on Sunday.</p>

<p>Finding himself in this difficulty, the Count asked
the advice of his friend, Sir Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p>“I should risk going on a weekday, if I were you,”
said Sir Edwin. “Wrap yourself up carefully, come
and have breakfast with me in St. John’s Wood Road,
and then we will go together to the engraver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>This they accordingly did, and, greatly to Landseer’s
relief, the Count passed through the streets unrecognised.</p>

<p>Not content, however, with escaping thus far, d’Orsay
found his freedom so delightful that he became
reckless, and did not seem at all disposed to return
in any haste to his captivity.</p>

<p>“It is so long since I have seen London on any
day but Sunday, I will enjoy myself now,” said he.
“Can’t we go to some place of amusement together?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus43">

<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="380" height="525" alt="" />

<p class="caption">SIR EDWIN LANDSEER, R. A.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Celebrated animal painter, though best known for his paintings of
dogs, his work was very varied and included the modeling of the
celebrated lions at the foot of the Nelson Monument in Trafalgar
Square.</p>

</div>

<p>Landseer suggested Madame Tussaud’s, an Exhibition
which d’Orsay had never before seen; and to
Baker Street they went. The Count, charmed with the
novelty of the wax figures, was childishly delighted
with all he saw, until a moment when he became conscious
that his footsteps were being dogged by two
suspicious-looking individuals.</p>

<p>“Do you see those men?” said d’Orsay. “They
never take their eyes from me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see them,” answered Landseer, who had
really noticed them for some time, but thought it wiser
not to say anything on the subject to his friend. “Let
us go into the Chamber of Horrors.”</p>

<p>Accordingly they paid their extra sixpences and entered
the mysterious inner room. The two men followed
them. Landseer gave up his friend for lost.
After a few moments of suspense one of the two men
advanced towards d’Orsay, hat in hand, and, making
an elaborate bow, said:</p>

<p>“Have I the honour of speaking to M. le Comte
d’Orsay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>No escape seemed possible now, so the Count drew
himself up and answered with much dignity:</p>

<p>“Sir, I am he.”</p>

<p>“Then, if M. le Comte will be so very kind as to
allow me, Madame Tussaud presents her compliments,
and she will be greatly honoured if M. le Comte will
give her some sittings and will permit us to add his
illustrious figure to those already in our establishment.”</p>

<p>Finding that all his anxieties were at an end, d’Orsay
forgot his dignity in a moment, almost embracing the
man in his sudden joy, and exclaiming, with his accents
of broken English:</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you shall do what you like.”</p>

<p>The handsome face and distinguished figure of the
Count were, of course, sufficiently remarkable to attract
attention anywhere, and Madame Tussaud had
too keen an eye for business ever to let slip so excellent
an opportunity.</p>

<p>This may be regarded as an interesting reminiscence
of the old rooms in Baker Street and the people who
used to frequent them three-quarters of a century ago.</p>

<p>Although we know that Queen Victoria came to visit
the Exhibition in Baker Street as Princess Victoria,
there is no direct evidence that she ever came as Queen.</p>

<p>There is, however, a story that on one occasion Her
Majesty paid a private visit with her children. When
it is remembered that the Cattle Show used to be held
in the rooms underneath the Exhibition, and that Her
Majesty used to pay it at least one annual visit in
those days, it is quite reasonable to suppose that the
Queen would take an opportunity of going upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The story goes that seventy years ago, a fortnight
after an auctioneer had murdered Mr. Jermy, Recorder
of Norwich, and his family, at Stanfield Hall,
near Wymondham, a Norfolk farmer came to London
for the Cattle Show, and was an unconscious interviewer
of Queen Victoria in the Exhibition.</p>

<p>I will give the narrative in his own words, being
unable to vouch for its authenticity.</p>

<p>“After,” said the farmer, “I had been to the show
and carefully examined the different animals, and given
my meed of praise to the breeders and their feeders, I
thought I would devote a spare hour to Madame Tussaud’s
celebrated Exhibition. Accordingly I presented
myself at the door, and paid my money.</p>

<p>“On entering, I was surprised to find that I was
the only spectator. Undisturbed for some time, I
wandered about, looking with astonishment at the
waxen effigies, habited in their gorgeous apparel.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes some ladies and children arrived,
and, standing near to one of the former I said, ‘What
ugly, grim-looking people some of those kings and
queens are!’ The lady smiled and answered, ‘I perfectly
agree with you; they are!’</p>

<p>“My attention was soon arrested by hearing one of
the party, pointing to a figure, mention Lord Nelson,
when, proud of having been born in the same county
as the illustrious sailor, I could not help exclaiming,
‘Ah, he was from my neighbourhood!’ Upon which
one of the ladies, advancing, said to me, ‘Then you are
from Norfolk? Pray can you tell me anything about
poor Mrs. Jermy with whose melancholy fate I so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
deeply sympathise? Have you any information different
from that which has appeared in the public papers?’</p>

<p>“To this I replied, ‘No, madam, for I have been
some days from home.’</p>

<p>“Scarcely had this conversation ended when Madame
Tussaud herself entered, and seeing me there asked
me how I got in, and if I did not know she had forbidden
the entrance of anyone. I replied I did not;
but, having paid my money had walked in as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>“Judge of my surprise when she informed me I had
had the honour of speaking to no other than our good
and gracious Queen, and that the lady whose tender
anxiety had been so warmly expressed for the injured
widow of Stanfield Hall was the same illustrious person
whose exalted rank does not, however, so elevate
her but that the misfortunes and afflictions of others
can reach her heart and excite her generous commiseration.</p>

<p>“The party who accompanied Her Majesty were the
royal children and their attendants.”</p>

<p>Wellington visits the effigy of the dead Napoleon, and sits to Sir
George Hayter for historic picture&mdash;Paintings from models&mdash;Is
the photograph “taken from life,” or&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

</div>

<p>Wellington gazing upon the effigy of Napoleon
is one of the many instances of a really
fine picture being produced from an original work
executed in our studios. Upon it hangs an interesting
story.</p>

<p class="caption">WELLINGTON VISITING THE EFFIGY OF NAPOLEON</p>

<p class="captionsub">From the celebrated picture by Sir George Hayter.</p>

</div>

<p>Early one morning, soon after the Exhibition had
been opened for the day, Joseph, Madame Tussaud’s
son, who had been wandering through the rooms, as
was his habit, perceived an elderly gentleman in front
of the tableau representing the lying-in-state of Napoleon
I.</p>

<p>The model of the dead exile rested&mdash;as it does down
to this very day&mdash;on the camp bedstead used by Napoleon
at St. Helena, and was dressed in the favourite
green uniform, the cloak worn at Marengo (bequeathed
by Napoleon to his son) lying across the feet. In the
hands, crossed upon the chest, was a crucifix. In those
days it was the custom to lower at night the curtains
that enclosed the bed, in order to exclude the dust,
whereas now the whole scene is encased in glass.</p>

<p>Observing that the visitor was desirous of seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
effigy, and no attendant being at hand, Joseph Tussaud
raised the hangings, whereupon the visitor removed his
hat, and, to his great surprise, Joseph saw that he was
face to face with none other than the great Duke of
Wellington himself.</p>

<p>There stood his Grace, contemplating with feelings
of mixed emotions the strange and suggestive scene before
him.</p>

<p>On the camp bed lay the mere presentment of the
man who, seven-and-thirty years before, had given him
so much trouble to subdue.</p>

<p>No feeling of triumph passed through the conqueror’s
mind as he looked upon the poor waxen image, too
true in its aspect of death; he rather thought upon the
vanity of earthly triumphs, of the levelling hand of
time, and how soon he, like his great contemporary,
might be stretched upon his own bier.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Tussaud used frequently to recall this
dramatic meeting between the Iron Duke and the effigy
of his erstwhile foe, and to imagine the feelings of
the old General as he gazed upon the couch. It was
probably the first of the Duke’s many visits to the
Exhibition.</p>

<p>A few days after this most interesting visit Mr.
Tussaud, who was an old friend of Sir George Hayter,
related the incident to that artist.</p>

<p>Hayter was immediately struck with the potential
value of the event for the production of a painting
of the historic scene, and the Tussaud brothers at once
commissioned him to execute the work for them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;" id="illus45">

<img src="images/illus45.jpg" width="380" height="435" alt="" />

<p class="caption">SIR GEORGE HAYTER</p>

<p class="captionsub">Whose painting of Wellington visiting the effigy of Napoleon is now
on exhibition in the Napoleon rooms at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir George thereupon communicated the idea to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Duke, who readily responded, and offered to give the
necessary sittings. We have the sketches made by
Hayter in preparation for the work, and among them
appears a drawing of Joseph Tussaud himself, although
he does not enter the actual picture.</p>

<p>Hearing that the artist was making progress with
the painting, the Duke visited his studio, and, having
expressed himself warmly in appreciation of the
picture (the figures had been but lightly limned in at
the time), said:</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you’ll want me to sit for my picture
here?”</p>

<p>Hayter has given us a most characteristic portrait
of Wellington as he then appeared. He is dressed in
his usual blue frock-coat, white trousers, and white
cravat, fastened with the familiar steel buckle. He
stoops a little as was his wont, his head is lightly
covered with snow-white hair, and his manly features
are marked with an expression of mingled curiosity
and sadness as, hat in hand, he looks upon the recumbent
Napoleon. The picture was completed early in
December, 1852, and has been on view in the Napoleon
Rooms at the Exhibition ever since.</p>

<p>The engravings of the picture have been circulated
in thousands throughout the world, and, strange to
say, they are exceedingly popular in Austria. It is
an interesting fact that the painting in question was
the last portrait for which the Duke ever sat.</p>

<p>This story brings to mind several instances in which
the members of the Tussaud family, especially in days
gone by, have produced subjects for other artists to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
paint from. For example, the model of Marat stabbed
in his bath&mdash;which has been shown in our Exhibition
ever since it existed in Paris&mdash;was modelled expressly
to assist the famous David to paint his picture representing
the death of the miscreant.</p>

<p>Strange to say, a replica of this painting was offered
to us a year or so ago, and the dealer who submitted
it insisted that it was the picture from which our model
was copied. He looked wofully incredulous when
it was explained to him that the boot was on the other
foot, and that the picture had been copied from the
model.</p>

<p>On one occasion, in a newsagent’s shop, a lady customer
asked for a picture postcard of King Edward.
Several were shown to her, but after inspecting them
she pushed all the direct photographs on one side, and
selected the print of a figure that had been modelled.
The shopkeeper subsequently stated that this card was
almost invariably chosen in preference to others.</p>

<p>In recent years there has grown a curious disposition
on the part of certain publishers to exploit for
their own purposes work produced in our studios. This
is not to be wondered at when photographs of our models
have been so often mistaken for portraits taken
direct from life.</p>

<p>We have ourselves on many occasions photographed
our likenesses for reproduction by the Press; and, apart
from this, newspaper representatives, times out of number,
have requested permission to take a photograph
of figures in the Exhibition for the use of their own
journal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also the inevitable snapshotter, who neither
asks permission nor cares whether it is granted or not.
Such individuals seize an opportunity when few persons
are about and take an illicit “negative” without
risking a verbal one. The result has been that the
photographs thus secured&mdash;all subject to copyright fees
never collected&mdash;have been made use of for all kinds
of purposes; they have turned up as blocks in newspapers
and magazines, illustrations in books, and portrait
postcards, besides being treasured in albums and
framed as pictures.</p>

<p>Only very occasionally has a statement accompanied
publication acknowledging the source from which the
picture has originated&mdash;a circumstance that has more
than once led to a curious and, so far as the artist is
concerned, a somewhat vexatious contretemps.</p>

<p>It has so happened that we have had sometimes to
send a member of our staff in quest of all the latest
photographs of a favourite celebrity whose figure we
have desired to remodel and bring up to date. Not
infrequently has he brought back with him “photographs”
purporting to have been taken from life, but
which have been instantly recognised as reproductions
of figures in the Exhibition.</p>

<p>A droll incident once occurred illustrative of this
strange situation.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when Mr. Joseph Tussaud, under
pressure of time and with very meagre material to go
upon, produced a portrait of the late Pope Leo XIII
directly after he was elevated to the papal chair, a certain
well-known firm of photographers were at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wits’ end to obtain a portrait of the new Pontiff, and
the novel idea suggested itself to them of arranging to
borrow for a short time Madame Tussaud’s model, and
therefrom obtain an original negative that might fulfil
their requirements. This they accordingly did, and the
object was achieved with remarkable success, for the
portrait challenged detection. So lifelike was the picture
that when it was placed upon the market beholders
concluded that the Pope had sat for it.</p>

<p>Another firm of photographers, some time afterwards,
and at great trouble and expense, succeeded
in obtaining sittings from the Pope himself.</p>

<p>When the portrait taken from life appeared, and
was compared with the photographs from the model,
very grave doubt was raised as to whether the new portrait
was really a good likeness, and many persons
questioned its genuineness, much to the chagrin of the
photographers who produced it.</p>

<p>The story of Colour-Sergeant Bates’s march through England to
prove Anglo-American goodwill&mdash;Start from Gretna&mdash;The dove
of peace.</p>

</div>

<p>An ephemeral celebrity of a bygone day, who fittingly
comes into the picture at the present time&mdash;for
we are still dealing with events that happened
in the seventies&mdash;was Colour-Sergeant Gilbert H.
Bates, of the 24th Massachusetts (U. S. Artillery)
Regiment.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus46">

<img src="images/illus46.jpg" width="380" height="535" alt="" />

<p class="caption">COLOR-SERGEANT GILBERT H. BATES OF THE 24TH MASSACHUSETTS
(U. S. ARTILLERY) REGIMENT</p>

<p class="captionsub">His famous pilgrimage, in November, 1872, from Gretna Green to
London, bearing aloft a large American flag, brought forth striking
testimony to the undercurrent of cordiality in England for all things
American. Photographed from the wax model at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

</div>

<p>This gallant soldier of the Federal Army, after carrying
the Star-spangled Banner through the Southern
States of America to prove that the war had not killed
the respect felt for the national flag, crossed the Atlantic,
in fulfilment of a wager, and bore the Stars and
Stripes from Gretna Green to London, amid most enthusiastic
scenes, demonstrating that Bates was right
when he insisted that John Bull and Uncle Sam were
the best of friends at heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Tussaud modelled a portrait of the
sergeant, who had an honoured place in the Exhibition
for several years.</p>

<p>Bates was a patriotic American who had a firm belief
in the friendship of the English people for their American
brethren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>For 1,500 miles through States whose streets had
been stained with the blood of civil carnage he had
marched with the national flag to the strains of patriotic
music, an eloquent tribute to his countrymen’s
deep-rooted love of peace. His passage was a triumphant
success, and the exploit is handed down to posterity
in Captain Mayne Reid’s stirring poem “From
Vicksburg to the Sea,” the first of its five verses being:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bear on the banner, soldier bold!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">How Southern hearts must thrill</div>
<div class="verse">To see the flag, so loved of all,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Waving above them still!</div>
<div class="verse">What chords ’twill touch, what echoes wake,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of that far truer time!</div>
<div class="verse">Who knows but it the spell may break</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That maddened them to crime.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was remotely the origin of Bates’s English expedition.
Calumny was rife in the States. No theme
had been so often discussed for the two years then past
as that of the feeling of John Bull towards Uncle
Sam. The malicious craft of certain politicians had
led them to foster elements of hatred towards the Old
Country, and a corrupt section of the Press had lent
itself to the unworthy task of exaggerating trifles and
distorting facts to suit the fancies of gullible readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the course of one such discussion as to the
feeling of the English towards Americans that this
lover of concord was led to make a wager of 100 dollars
against 1,000 dollars that the people of England
would not insult the flag of America, but would welcome
it heartily wherever it should be borne by an
American soldier. Not a few of his compatriots were
incredulous of his success, and they predicted that he
would miserably fail; while one said, “I bet he don’t
travel twelve miles before he sets face homeward and
leaves his bean-pole in the custody of some parish
beadle.”</p>

<p>The gallant sergeant was determined and confident,
however, and, taking passage in the Anchor liner <i>Europa</i>,
he crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Bates was a small but well-built man, 5 feet 7½
inches in height, square-shouldered and square-headed,
clean shaven, with clear grey eyes, dark hair, and
swarthy skin. His age was thirty-four, and he wore
the uniform of a sergeant of the Federal Army. He
is described as modest, intelligent, well-informed, and
a very good specimen of the unassuming, matter-of-fact,
and practical Yankee.</p>

<p>The flag he carried was from a piece of army bunting
from the headquarters of General Sheridan. It was of
regulation size, 6 feet by 6½ feet, and the hickory
staff measured 9 feet. Before he left he was assured
by a Member of Parliament in Chicago that as the
Americans had honoured the English Prince when he
visited that country, the English people, in return,
would honour the American “prince”&mdash;which was their
flag. And so it turned out.</p>

<p>On the 5th of November, 1872&mdash;Guy Fawkes Day
and the anniversary of the Battle of Inkerman&mdash;Sergeant
Bates left Edinburgh for Gretna Green, that
romantic spot at the southern extremity of Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
It was with difficulty that he managed to leave the
northern city without unfurling the flag, as his Scottish
friends felt that they should have an opportunity of
testifying their good feelings to the banner which waved
over so many of their kindred in homes beyond the
Atlantic. But his mission had been planned, and he
had decided to begin his march from the border of
England itself.</p>

<p>With no quiver of fear and with a heart full of
gladness, he stood upon Sark Bridge and, uncovering
his head, gave the Star-spangled Banner to the breeze.
A few merry rustics greeted him with cheers, and the
historic march was begun. The country before him
was England, the mother-country, the home of the
English language, the freest and most peaceful country
in Europe.</p>

<p>He reached Carlisle that evening without anything
more important happening than a rigid cross-examination
by an excited old woman as to whether he was
heralding a Fenian invasion, and an anxious inquiry
from a little boy as to when the circus would arrive.</p>

<p>At the Bush Hotel at Carlisle a party of commercial
travellers gave him a right hearty British welcome,
and this henceforth became the order of the day at
whatever town or village he put in an appearance.
News of his coming preceded him, and his progress was
one continuous ovation, culminating in a veritable furore
when he reached his journey’s end.</p>

<p>Through Penrith and Shap, where he was cheered
by the miners, who had sent men from the quarries to
watch for his approach, he made his way to Kendal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
where, at a dinner given in his honour, he announced
that he had written to cancel the wager he had made.
He did this in token of the purity of his motives, and
to prove that he was not actuated by mercenary considerations.</p>

<p>From Kendal he proceeded to Lancaster, which city
he entered followed by an enormous crowd, a similar
concourse escorting him to the outskirts on his departure.</p>

<p>Garstang, between Lancaster and Preston, at that
time enjoyed the peculiar distinction of having a Mayor
and capital burgesses without its having been constituted
a borough. Here he was entertained at a sumptuous
repast, and the streets were full of people, the
church scholars, drawn up in line, cheering the flag
and its bearer as they passed.</p>

<p>The streets of Preston were lined with spectators;
at Chorley cheers were given for the Queen and President
Grant; and at Bolton the flag-bearer was presented
with a pair of clogs, and given a live turtle-dove
to take back with him to the American President.</p>

<p>He was almost carried by an eager, applauding
crowd along Bradshawgate on his way to Manchester,
and the <cite>Bolton Evening News</cite> of the 14th of November,
1872, records that “there was more hand-shaking
than we have ever seen bestowed on any person. Far
from insult, every respect was shown to the flag of the
great Republic, and,” the newspaper facetiously adds,
“if the bearer is rewarded all along his journey as he
was at Farnworth, his pockets will be filled with the
metal that makes the mare to go.”</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Sergeant Bates’s journey finishes in London amid a remarkable
demonstration&mdash;His gift to Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

</div>

<p>In this chapter we conclude the story of the gallant
sergeant’s historic march with the American flag
from Gretna Green to London.</p>

<p>At Bolton he was presented with a piece of silver-plate,
and a pedestrian gave him a pocket-knife; but
this gift was followed immediately afterwards by a
letter in which the writer said that as the giving of
a sharp instrument was regarded as a bad omen and
portended to cut friendship, he asked Sergeant Bates
to forward a penny stamp in the enclosed envelope in
order that the knife might be <em>sold</em> and not given. The
penny stamp was sent.</p>

<p>Five miles from Cottonopolis Bates was met by a
man who had been a lieutenant in the 24th Massachusetts
Volunteers during the Civil War, who took
off his hat and said, “God bless our flag.” Manchester
was reached on the 14th of November, and here the
flag had an immense reception, the crowd in Market
Street being so dense that the open carriage which the
sergeant was obliged to enter could scarcely make headway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Lodged at the Royal Hotel, he was presented with
a Union Jack, and was pestered by several enterprising
showmen, one of whom offered him as much as £60
a night for five weeks if he would only consent to lend
himself and the flag; but this he resolutely declined
to do.</p>

<p>From Manchester to Macclesfield he met with a
repetition of the same hearty ovations. The crowd
kept slapping him on the shoulders, shaking hands,
slipping money into his pockets, hurrahing, singing,
and even dancing with joy before the glorious old flag.</p>

<p>At Macclesfield he was treated like a prince, royally
entertained, and presented with a gold breast-pin by
the Mayor. Through Congleton, Burslem, Stafford,
Wolverhampton, and so on to Birmingham, the march
was like that of a triumphant warrior, the crowds at
Bates’s heels, marshalled in military order, tramping
along singing the national melodies of the two countries,
“Rule Britannia” and “Yankee Doodle” being
the favourite airs.</p>

<p>At West Bromwich, where the flag-bearer stood for
a moment to salute the Union Jack, a man rushed out
and crowned his flagstaff with laurel. He entered
Birmingham escorted by a crowd of all classes, both
sexes and all ages, and the proprietor of the “Hen and
Chickens” Hotel placed the house, the wine-cellar, and
even his cash-drawer at his guest’s disposal.</p>

<p>The crowd from Birmingham followed him for some
miles out of the town. There was a vast amount of
hand-shaking, and several women insisted on embracing
him, one old lady hugging him so unmercifully that she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
he, and the flag were nearly sent sprawling in the mud.</p>

<p>One workman, bareheaded and without his coat,
headed the procession in a perfect frenzy of excitement,
and shook hand with Bates about every five minutes.
It appeared that he had served on the <i>Alabama</i>,
and seemed to think that he was atoning for past transgression
and ridding himself of the stigma of having
fought against the Union.</p>

<p>Warwick was visited, and the castle inspected. The
sergeant was shown over Shakespeare’s birthplace at
Stratford-on-Avon by a Mrs. Hathaway and a lady
aptly quoted to him the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Leamington he was presented with an address
and a silver Maltese Cross. Southam and Banbury
were passed through, and then he came to Oxford,
where, it had been predicted, his mission would fail
ignominiously.</p>

<p>But he was met by students from New College, who
treated him with great gentlemanliness, one observing:</p>

<p>“Sergeant, you surely never expected that the people
of England would fall upon one man, did you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bates drawing himself up. “I have
come through England not only believing that my flag
would not be insulted, but feeling sure that Englishmen
would show it such respect everywhere that my
countrymen would hail my coming as a step full of
joyful hope for the future.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” exclaimed the undergraduate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Invitations poured in upon the happy soldier. He
supped in University College and breakfasted in
Trinity.</p>

<p>At a levee in the reception-room at the “Roebuck”
the toast was given, “May the stars never shine with
less lustre, nor the bars ever grow shorter,” which was
received with musical honours:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It’s a way they have in the Army,</div>
<div class="verse">It’s a way they have in the Navy,</div>
<div class="verse">It’s a way we have in the ’Varsity</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To drive dull care away.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On through High Wycombe and Uxbridge passed
the soldier with his flag, and the crowd was great as
he set out for Shepherd’s Bush, whence he was to proceed
through London.</p>

<p>There were incidents humorous and pathetic.</p>

<p>At one place an aged woman tottered up to him
from a wayside house and, leaning on her stick, said:</p>

<p>“Let me touch the flag and give my blessing to the
bearer. My youngest boy fought for that flag and
died for it in your country. He fell with that flag in
his hand.”</p>

<p>Her son, an Englishman, had given his life fighting
for the Union.</p>

<p>At another place a grimy sweep, fresh from a job,
embraced the American most affectionately.</p>

<p>Bates’s quarters at Shepherd’s Bush were at the
“Telegraph,” and during the Friday evening the hotel
was in a state of siege. Sir John Bennett, an ex-Sheriff
of the City of London, had offered to lend the soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a carriage; but it was ultimately decided to use an open
equipage drawn by a pair of greys, one of them
mounted by a postilion.</p>

<p>The daily papers of the 2nd of December, 1872,
give a full account of the proceedings. Seated in the
carriage was Sergeant Bates, holding his beloved flag,
while two other flags, the Union Jack and the Star-spangled
Banner, trailed behind, the horses’ trappings
being decorated with international symbols.</p>

<p>Up Notting Hill, along Bayswater Road, and
through Oxford Street passed the carriage, surrounded
and followed by a huge and demonstrative crowd.</p>

<p>In Bond Street the horses were taken out, and the
carriage was dragged by some twenty-five persons along
St. James’s Street, Pall Mall, by Charing Cross, and
through the Strand and Fleet Street, up Ludgate Hill,
and along Cheapside, to the Guildhall.</p>

<p>A dense mass of people had congregated in the Guildhall
yard, where a British sergeant was carrying the
English standard. The scene beggared description.
The Guildhall itself was full to overflowing, and having
alighted, Bates had perforce to be lifted on shoulders
and hoisted, flag and all, back into the carriage,
from which place of vantage he made a speech before
refurling his banner.</p>

<p>He was delighted with his reception in the heart
of the great Metropolis, and never forgot the sea of
faces, the endless crowds, the fluttering flags, the waving
handkerchiefs, the cheers, and the kindly greeting
of that memorable day. His hand seemed to have been
wrung into pulp, and he was struck with the phrasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the oft-repeated salutation, “Give us your hand,
old pal.”</p>

<p>Cabmen had little American flags mounted on their
vehicles or pinned to their horses’ heads, ladies had
the Stars and Stripes for carriage-aprons, and children
waved toy flags.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bates was somewhat annoyed by relic hunters,
who, could they have had their way, would soon
have whittled his flagstaff into imperceptible pieces and
riven the banner into a thousand shreds.</p>

<p>He gave a piece of flag and his boots to Madame
Tussaud’s Exhibition as a small offering to those of
the British public “who,” as he quaintly remarked,
“worship such things, and who find at Madame Tussaud’s
perhaps the best field for the satisfaction of
their curiosity.”</p>

<p>Writing from the Langham Hotel, where he was
staying, he observed that Madame Tussaud’s had previously
voted him a niche among the immortal heroes
who adorned their Exhibition, a mark of honour for
which he was told he ought to feel no small pride.</p>

<p>And what had Sergeant Bates accomplished? He
claimed to have succeeded in bringing the two great
nations’ hearts near to each other, till they seemed to
beat in unison, and the pulsation of the one was for
a while that of the other.</p>

<p>“God grant,” he said, “that work so begun may
not willingly be laid down.”</p>

<p>Although he was called at one and the same time “a
hare-brained visionary,” “a patriot,” “a fool,” “a man
of courage,” and “a remarkably shrewd, thoughtful individual,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
there can be no doubt that he did at least
something to promote international amity, and to cement
the feeling of warm friendship which was found
to exist in this country towards her daughter America.</p>

<p>The continuation of that tie has been, and is still
being, abundantly manifested ever since the United
States joined the Allies in their recent determined fight
for freedom; and there are thousands who echo Sergeant
Bates’s words:</p>

<p>“May the flags of both countries ever wave in freedom
and peace till that ‘far truer time’ when there shall
be but one flag, because but one people on the face
of the earth!”</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>My first model&mdash;Beaconsfield’s curl&mdash;Gladstone’s collar&mdash;John Bright
and the Chinaman.</p>

</div>

<p>We now come to a period when I may well speak
of my own personal knowledge concerning
men and events in association with Madame Tussaud’s
Exhibition.</p>

<p>The year 1872 was remarkable for several noteworthy
events. Two or three, in addition to the National
Thanksgiving Day for the recovery of the Prince
of Wales from serious illness, vividly recur to memory.
Among them was the assassination of the Earl of Mayo,
Viceroy of India, who was stabbed by a convict while
inspecting the settlement at Port Blair on the Andaman
Islands.</p>

<p>The models of the Prince of Wales and the murdered
Viceroy were introduced to the Exhibition within
a few days of each other, and the sympathetic public
responded in great numbers.</p>

<p>A startling and remarkable tribute to the Viceroy’s
portrait was “unconsciously” paid when the Earl’s
housekeeper fainted on suddenly finding herself in
the presence of the model of her late master.</p>

<p>The first portrait I was entrusted with, as my father’s
understudy, was that of Prince Milan of Serbia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the memory of whom has long since passed into oblivion,
like that of many others whose stay has been
brief among the figures. This was followed by a head
of perennial interest, that of Benjamin Disraeli, which
I was called upon to remodel on several occasions in
after years. Clearly do I recall his characteristic features,
so marvellously grasped by Tenniel, whose cartoons
in <cite>Punch</cite> I never tired of studying.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that one of the marked peculiarities
of Disraeli’s general appearance was the
famous curl he wore upon his forehead. Of that circumstance
I am at this moment somewhat forcibly reminded
by a letter disclosing the remarkable fact that
the curl is still in existence, almost forty years after
the great statesman has passed away. Here is an
extract from the letter offering the forelock to us as
a relic:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Obersley, Near Droitwich, Worcester, March 7, 1918.</i></p>

<p>My aunt, Miss Louise Hennet, nursed Lord Beaconsfield
during his last illness, and the two locks (one the
celebrated curl) were given to her. She was sent to
nurse him from the nursing institution of St. John the
Divine. The hair is enclosed in paper, which is endorsed
in Miss Hennet’s writing, and this can be identified.</p>

</div>

<p>The letter is duly signed.</p>

<p>It may be easily understood that the modelling of
the features of celebrated people stamps the memory
of the artist with a deep and abiding impression. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
had but shortly seen my father produce a very striking
portrait of Marshal Bazaine, solely remembered
now for his dramatic surrender at Metz on the 27th
of October, 1870.</p>

<p>A small knot of interested people attracted my attention
towards a stout, elderly man of military bearing
as he was leaving Mr. Adams-Acton’s studios in Salisbury
Place, Regent’s Park. I was astonished to recognise
in him the living counterpart of the before-mentioned
model.</p>

<p>It was Marshal Bazaine himself, who had but recently
escaped from the fortress of Ile Ste. Marguerite,
near Cannes. I was much struck by the fact that the
ill-starred soldier of the Second Empire looked in no
way dejected, despite the disaster that had befallen his
reputation.</p>

<p>I am often asked what are the qualifications people
must possess for a place in Madame Tussaud’s. I
can give no better answer than that the public shall demand
to see them, for should the portraits of such people
be omitted they are invariably inquired for by disappointed
visitors.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how great a hold must be taken of
the public mind by candidates for inclusion in Madame
Tussaud’s Exhibition before their election to our house
would be welcomed by our patrons.</p>

<p>Of course, we are now associating our minds only
with reputable society. As regards the Chamber of
Horrors&mdash;of which I shall have something to say when
the time comes&mdash;I may here remark that it is the
notorious characters solely who seem to have a prescriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
right to enter that abode of gloom, which
used to be called in the old days the “Dead Room,”
hardly so telling a title as the “Chamber of Horrors,”
for which, by the way, we are indebted to our dear
old friend “Mr. Punch.”</p>

<p>As to those people who retain a permanent place in
the Exhibition, I suppose the secret is that, either by
the example of their lives or through the medium of
their works, they have deeply touched the heart or
stirred the imagination of the people.</p>

<p>I suppose the British public never looked on two
such political gladiators as Beaconsfield and Gladstone,
and while these two statesmen dominated people’s
minds it was natural that they should both have
a pedestal at Madame Tussaud’s. I can neither say
who was first to appear in the Exhibition, nor prophesy
who will be the last to go. They are both there now,
and still attract much notice from persons of all shades
of political opinion.</p>

<p>So often had these figures to be remodelled, to
keep pace with the changes worked by time and the
strenuous nature of their public service, that there
must now repose, carefully stowed away in our “catacombs,”
impressions of their features sufficient to cover
the whole gamut of their political careers.</p>

<p>For more than a generation the Beaconsfield curl
and the Gladstone collar exercised a subtle influence
in the political world, mainly through the cartoons
and caricatures of John Tenniel and Harry Furniss.</p>

<p>One has to be meticulously careful with regard to
important details such as these; and when Mr. Gladstone’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
figure had to be remodelled in later years, it
was thought advisable, in order to be quite correct,
that a collar actually belonging to the “G. O. M.”
should be inspected.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone was living at Carlton House Terrace
at the time the new portrait was in progress; and our
“Master of the Robes,” who was responsible for the
accuracy of detail respecting all Exhibition costumes,
called there, and, on examining the statesman’s collars,
was surprised to find that they were of quite normal
size, and not so high as the caricaturist represented
them to be.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the collars were made to fit
loosely round the neck, and thus allowed the wearer’s
chin to sink behind their upstanding ends. It is gratifying
to record that permission to view her husband’s
collars was graciously given to our representative by
Mrs. Gladstone herself.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion when Mr. Gladstone had
been notified that Mr. Harry Furniss, the originator
of the big collar, would be at a dinner to which he
himself was invited, the Liberal leader purposely wore
a collar of more than usually modest dimensions, possibly
as a gentle rebuke to his caricaturist.</p>

<p>The model which approached nearest to these in popularity
at the time was that of John Bright, the great
Anti-Corn Law Leaguer and apostle of Free Trade.
His portrait has long since stood beside that of Richard
Cobden, and these two inseparable reformers must remain
together for good, as they laboured together in
their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on one of the occasions when Bright’s likeness
had been brought up to date that an incident,
rather flattering to the modeller, occurred in the House
of Commons.</p>

<p>An influential Chinaman, on being shown the sights
of London, was taken to the Houses of Parliament,
where he happened to notice a prominent member passing
through one of the lobbies. Without ceremony the
Chinaman pounced upon John Bright, and shook him
heartily by the hand. The genial statesman was highly
amused at the spontaneous greeting, and inquired how
it was the Chinaman knew him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he replied, “I knew you at once. I have just
come from seeing you at Madame Tussaud’s.”</p>

<p>The Tichborne “Claimant”&mdash;Nearly an explosion&mdash;The big man’s
clothes&mdash;The real heir&mdash;The Claimant’s release from prison&mdash;Confession
and death.</p>

</div>

<p>I can hardly allow this period to pass without making
some reference to the fact that from 1872
till 1874&mdash;when he was sentenced, on the 28th of
February, to fourteen years’ penal servitude&mdash;the name
of the “Claimant” to the Tichborne baronetcy and
estates was on every lip, and it seems to me that no
trial in my time has ever engrossed public attention to
such a degree.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus50">

<img src="images/illus50.jpg" width="380" height="525" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE TICHBORNE “CLAIMANT”</p>

<p class="captionsub">Central figure in a famous perjury trial in England. An impression
was made of him before his conviction to penal servitude and another
model was made eleven years later on his return.</p>

</div>

<p>People flocked to see the Claimant’s portrait when
it was added to the collection, and perhaps that was
the first time one saw queues assembled outside the
doors of Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>The various incidents of this historic case absorbed
my youthful attention, and I recall how, at his
house in Kentish Town, the Claimant submitted to
the ordeal of having an impression taken of his
hands to show the curly thumbs and a scar on
his wrist which formed subjects of comment in the
courts.</p>

<p>I was struck by the Claimant’s enormous size, which
yet did not seem to hinder his movements, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
agility of the bulky man was indeed extraordinary;
and equally surprising were the acuteness of his mind
and the suavity of his manner.</p>

<p>To save him the inconvenience of fulfilling appointments
in the Exhibition studios, my father had a special
gas-light fixed at the Claimant’s house that sittings
might be taken in the evenings.</p>

<p>This device, curiously enough, once put the life of
the Claimant in jeopardy. An old gasfitter in our
employment, named Dallender, who had done some
stage work, introduced an apparatus such as was used
in the theatres. Something went wrong with the
manipulation of the arrangements, and the room became
charged with gas. A servant was about to enter
the apartment with a light, when the Claimant himself
stopped her on noticing the strong smell. But
for this fact the famous Tichborne trial might have
had a sudden and tragic termination.</p>

<p>The Claimant showed certain qualities which hardly
tallied with the character of the “uneducated butcher”
he was declared to be. Proof that he had some refinement
of feeling&mdash;or was he merely actuated by that
vanity frequently found among men of his class?&mdash;may
be inferred from an incident that greatly impressed
my father.</p>

<p>The Claimant had promised that he would provide
a fresh suit of clothes for his model in the Exhibition,
and, in fulfilment of his promise, after the sentence
had been passed upon him, he beckoned from the table
at which he was seated in court to an attendant, and
handed him the suit of clothes, saying:</p>

<p>“Please see to these being delivered at Madame Tussaud’s,
as they are expected there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>This fact strikes one as being remarkable, having
regard to the anxiety of mind he must undoubtedly
have suffered at the close of the trial.</p>

<p>It was a curious coincidence that I revisited my old
college at Ramsgate about this time, and there had
pointed out to me, among the students, the young heir
to the Tichborne estates, whose title had been made
clear by the conviction of the Claimant for perjury.</p>

<p>The students were on their way to the refectory,
and the youthful heir appeared more concerned over
the prospect of a good dinner than the result of the
case upon which his future depended.</p>

<p>Stories of the Claimant were countless as he strode
like a Colossus through the country in the long interval
between his civil case and the criminal trial that succeeded
it.</p>

<p>He was mobbed by sympathisers everywhere, and
men and women shook hands with him, as if it bestowed
a distinction on themselves. There was one
amusing story at the time of a wealthy Yorkshire manufacturer
whose wife said to him when they entertained
the Claimant to dinner:</p>

<p>“John, how we are slithering into Society!”</p>

<p>After he had served eleven years’ imprisonment, his
sentence having been reduced through good conduct,
the Claimant came to the Exhibition to learn if he
could be of any further service to us, or we to him.
His ponderous bulk was so much reduced by prison
fare that we should not have known him. He said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he was none the worse for the period of enforced “banting,”
which reduced his weight without injuring his
health.</p>

<p>The Claimant gave me several sittings at this time,
and a new model was substituted for the old one. He
spoke freely of his prison experiences, and said:</p>

<p>“It was not easy to be philosophical when set to tease
oakum, but eventually I bowed to my fate cheerfully
enough. It is some consolation to know that thousands
still believe in the justice of my claim to the
Tichborne estates.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the Claimant published in a
Sunday newspaper his signed confession, which he
is said to have afterwards recanted.</p>

<p>He survived his liberation from prison fourteen
years, and, gradually sinking into poverty, died in obscure
lodgings in Marylebone, not far from the Exhibition,
on the 2nd of April, 1898. The name engraved
on his coffin was “Sir Roger Charles Doughty
Tichborne,” thus maintaining his claim to the very
last.</p>

<p>In 1873 the nation was saddened by the death at
Ilala of Dr. Livingstone, the great missionary-explorer,
who, some time before, had disappeared in the
trackless wastes of Central Africa while preaching the
gospel to savages and making surveys of the great continent.
The name of Livingstone will always be bracketed
with that of H. M. Stanley, who, as the emissary
of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>, “discovered” him.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Missionary and African Explorer, whose model is in the

</div>

<p>When my father wrote to Stanley asking for a
sitting, he replied that he was too heavily engaged at
the time writing his book <cite>How I Found Livingstone</cite>,
and he proposed that the artist should call and make
a study of him at his desk. This he did, with the happy
result that he produced a very striking portrait.</p>

<p>The story of Stanley’s life is a romance in itself.</p>

<p>Born of poor parents at Denbigh, in Wales, about
1840, he at first bore the name of John Rowlands.
When about fifteen years of age he worked his way
as a cabin boy to New Orleans, where he was employed
by a merchant, name Stanley, whose name he assumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He served in the Confederate Army, contributed to
several journals, and in the year 1867 began his connection
with the <cite>New York Herald</cite>. As its special
correspondent he accompanied Lord Napier’s Abyssinian
Expedition, and the first news of the fall of Magdala
was conveyed to this country by his paper. He
next went to Spain for the <cite>Herald</cite>, and he was in Madrid
in October, 1869, when he received the peremptory
telegram “Come to Paris on important business.” He
immediately complied, and there received from Mr.
Bennett, junior, the laconic instruction and valediction,
“Find Livingstone! Good-night, and God be with
you.”</p>

<p>In January, 1871, Stanley reached Zanzibar, and
two months later marched into the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>It was on the 10th of November that he “found”
Livingstone at Ujiji. Well, indeed, as Stanley himself
admitted, was he repaid for all the dangers he
encountered on his journey when he grasped the hand
of the grey-haired old missionary&mdash;aged by climate and
exposure&mdash;whose whereabouts he had been sent to discover.</p>

<p>We placed in the Exhibition portrait models not only
of Stanley, attired in a facsimile of the explorer’s suit
worn by him on the occasion of the historic meeting,
but also one of Dr. Livingstone himself. Probably
many more persons have gazed upon the figure of Livingstone
in the Exhibition than ever paid a pilgrimage
to see his final resting-place in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Together with the model of Stanley was placed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
figure of his boy, Kalulu, concerning whom the explorer
wrote a book in 1873 (<cite>My Kalulu</cite>).</p>

<p>The son of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, the Prince

who pierced him with many assegais.</p>

<p>It had been suggested in the House of Commons that
an effigy to his memory should be erected in the Abbey,
in view of the fact that the young Bonaparte died in
one of England’s wars while serving under English
officers. A reference in <cite>Punch</cite> to this proposal suggested
that a much more suitable repository for a
memorial would be Madame Tussaud’s along with the

<p>About this time I met Count Léon, the natural
son of Napoleon the Great. The Count was
then nearing seventy years of age, and had taken refuge
in this country after the great <i lang="fr">débâcle</i> of 1870. He
lived in modest lodgings at Camden Town, and to pay
his way set about selling the last remaining relics of
the Imperial Family he had in his possession.</p>

<p>In a diary I now have before me I find that my
father visited him on the 31st of January, 1873, the
Count having expressed a wish to show him the family
heirlooms, with the view to their finding a permanent
resting-place among the many Napoleonic memorials
at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>The Count offered him a fine miniature of Napoleon
I’s brother, Lucien; a terra-cotta bust of Napoleon’s
mother, “Madame Mère”; and a snuff-box left by Napoleon
with Count Léon’s mother. The box contained
a portion of the snuff which the Emperor had been
using. There was also a lock of hair belonging to
Napoleon’s son, the Duc de Reichstadt, known in high
Imperial days as the King of Rome. One or two of
these relics were acquired for the Exhibition.</p>

were blue-grey. Count Léon returned to
France, leaving behind him in London his son Charles,
for whom I obtained a position in a City warehouse,
where he remained engaged for several years, being
at no pains to disguise his identity. My readers will
readily see that the name granted to his father by the
Emperor was composed of the last four letters in “Napoleon,”
a whimsical touch of Imperial humour.</p>

<p>Count Léon finally settled at Pontoise, some twenty
miles north-west of Paris, first at the Villa Davenport
in the Rue l’Hermitage and afterwards in the Rue de
Beaujon. This was his last stage. The room that he
made his final refuge he adorned with four portraits
of Napoleon, “my glorious father.”</p>

<p>To what depths had the Emperor’s son fallen! The
old man’s shirts were in rags; he could not afford clean
linen; he had to forgo tobacco. He died on the 14th
of April, 1881, and without pomp or ceremony his body
was laid in a pauper’s grave. His only memorial was
a grassy mound and a little black wooden cross that
soon rotted and fell to pieces.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, 1873, the Shah of Persia, accompanied
by his numerous suite, visited Madame Tussaud’s,
and was accorded a private view with some
pomp and formality. His visit to the Exhibition was
deemed of such importance that it gained the unusual
distinction of a special reference in the <cite>Court Circular</cite>.
Members of our Royal Household in considerable numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
attended in state, and formed an imposing assemblage.
The public was excluded.</p>

<p>The domes of the building were specially darkened
to give effect to the internal illuminations, which were
very beautiful. None enjoyed the function more than
the Shah himself, who laughed heartily as he pointed
at models he was able to recognise, and several times
turned from a figure to a person present, indicating
by a gesture and a chuckle his pride at discerning the
likeness. The merry monarch even went so far as to
pose among the figures as a real, live royal model.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Exhibition the Shah called for
pen and paper, and, surrounded by the distinguished
company, wrote in Persian the following: “Whilst
staying in London I visited Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition,
and wrote these words here by way of memorial
to my visit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nasserdin Chah Kadjar</span>, 1290
Haegira (1873).”</p>

<p>The above free translation was there and then made
by one of His Solar Highness’s secretaries, and it possesses
the charm of its own defects.</p>

<p>The “king of kings” was in his most humorously autocratic
vein among the unhallowed figures of the
Chamber of Horrors. He seemed to gloat over the
collection of criminals and notorieties, examining with
unaffected delight the guillotine which cut off so many
heads during the French Revolution.</p>

<p>The lunette in which the necks of the victims were
held in position greatly fascinated the Shah, who
hinted that a condemned prisoner should be brought
from one of the English gaols to be decapitated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the spot for the edification of himself and his attendants.</p>

<p>It was pointed out, as an evasive measure, that no
condemned man was available at that moment, whereupon
His Majesty turned to the members of his suite
and called for volunteers.</p>

<p>Such a thing, however, as an execution at Madame
Tussaud’s was out of the question, even to gratify
the whim of so illustrious a personage; and the Shah’s
retainers looked genuinely relieved when they gathered
that their royal master was not to have his way.</p>

<p>This period seemed to inaugurate a series of little
wars, which, nevertheless, then excited the interest of
the people, whose descendants may well remark how
comparatively small these wars were. The Ashantee
campaign ended in the fall of Coomassie on the 4th
of February, 1874, and Sir Garnet Wolseley added
fresh laurels to his fame. It was with real regret that
the public looked in vain for the portrait of King
Koffee at Madame Tussaud’s. As the dusky potentate
had evidently never had his photograph taken, and
as “sittings” were out of the question, we could not
very well gratify the public curiosity for lack of the
necessary data.</p>

<p>Not only did people expect to discover King Koffee’s
portrait, but they also clamoured to see his famous
umbrella, which Wolseley “borrowed” from His
Majesty’s mud-palace at Coomassie, and obviously
failed to return, for the umbrella was accepted as a
gift by Queen Victoria from the gallant Commander of
this brief and brilliant expedition. We confessed then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to a twinge of envy that the celebrated gamp had not
found its way to Madame Tussaud’s. We were, however,
amply compensated by the public favour with
which the portrait of Sir Garnet was received.</p>

<p class="captionsub">Deposed King of the Zulus, who visited England as the “guest of
the Government” and whose image in wax remains at Madame
Tussaud’s as a memorial of his visit.</p>

</div>

<p>The deposed King of the Zulus, Cetewayo, who was
subsequently restored to a portion of his kingdom, made
a considerable stir when he visited this country as the
“guest of the Government.” A friend who was appointed
to take shorthand notes when Cetewayo attended
at the Foreign Office enabled me to gain a view
of the burly black monarch, and I had an opportunity
of comparing the original with the many published
portraits.</p>

<p>He was a handsome type of a fine race, and looked
a king even among the stalwart members of his suite,
everyone of whom seemed to be six feet at least in
height and well-proportioned.</p>

<p>Cetewayo’s figure had been in the Exhibition some
time before, and it now became possible to bring it up
to date. Everything was done to impress Cetewayo
with the strength of the British Empire; but it was
discovered that the objects which appealed most to his
savage taste were the cattle in the fields, the cloth in
the factories, and the gewgaws and jewels in the shop
windows.</p>

<p>“He is uglier than that,” said an envoy of the Induna
King, Gungunhana, critically scrutinising Cetewayo’s
figure, when he visited the Exhibition in June,
1891.</p>

<p>This native envoy rejoiced in the name of Huluhulu-Untato,
his companion being Umfeti-Inteni.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
They thought the figures were really dead bodies which
had been preserved from decay. When told that they
were merely waxen images the Indunas expressed disappointment
that the white man had not completed
his work by putting breath into the bodies.</p>

<p>When Huluhulu came before the figure of Queen
Victoria he saluted Her silent Majesty, and stood
audibly worshipping her for a minute or two.</p>

subjects that kept our studios extremely busy, and also
brought a constant stream of visitors to the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The portrait of the Queen had now to be remodelled;
that of the Prince of Wales appeared in the garb of
a big-game hunter; and Disraeli’s doffed its ordinary
attire for the robes of a peer.</p>

<p>Following these “moving” events, we now come
to a period when the country became apprehensively
aware of ominous happenings in the Balkan States.</p>

<p>Russia declared war on Turkey in 1877, and forced
a clear road to Constantinople. This threat to our
Eastern Empire aroused the spirit of war, particularly
in London, and “gentlemen of the pavement,” as Bismarck
styled the men in the street, gloried in the ultra-patriotic
sentiment which obtained the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
“Jingo”; while music-halls and taverns rang with the

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield’s prompt demand that a halt
should be called to hostilities, for the adjustment of
differences between the belligerents, led to the Berlin
Congress, and gave us an excellent opportunity of adding
an imposing group of the European statesmen who
framed the Berlin Treaty.</p>

<p>Yet, so mercurial is the public taste, and so pronounced
is the love of the British race for anything
that is amusingly abnormal, that I doubt whether ten
people did not come to see the “Turnerelli wreath”
for one who came to scan the features of these great
peace-makers.</p>

<p>“What was the ‘Turnerelli wreath’?” the present
generation may ask. It was the pivot of a political
comedy that set the whole nation laughing.</p>

<p class="caption">EDWARD TRACY TURNERELLI</p>

<p class="captionsub">Promoter of “The People’s Tribute” refused by
Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

</div>

<p>Edward Tracy Turnerelli, a sculptor’s son, and himself
a sculptor, instituted a penny subscription to present
Lord Beaconsfield with a gold laurel wreath, which
he called “The People’s Tribute,” in appreciation of his
many services to the State and in commemoration of
his great part in the deliberations of the Berlin Congress.</p>

<p>Fifty-two thousand workmen subscribed their pennies
in vain, for Lord Beaconsfield courteously, but
firmly, declined the gift, and it was left on Turnerelli’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hands; while he, of course, could hardly be expected to
refund the copper contributions.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. J. H. Bottomley, Conservative
agent for Clapham, for a copy of the following interesting
autograph letter from Lord Beaconsfield, expressing
his satisfaction that the course he had adopted
in declining to accept the wreath had met with the approval
of many who had been induced to sanction
the proposed gift:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>10 Downing Street, Whitehall, August 11th, 1879.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the
9th inst.</p>

<p>It gives me much satisfaction to learn that the course
I felt it my duty to take with respect to a certain
pseudo-testimonial has met with the approval of many
of those who, originally, by misleading representations,
were induced to sanction a surreptitious gift.</p>

<p>I am gratified by the suggestion, which, on behalf
of various Conservative associations, you put before
me, that I should receive a National Address of confidence
as a substitution for the rejected offering, but
when I call to mind that the present policy of Her
Majesty’s Government, unchanged and unshaken, is
precisely the same as that which, scarcely a year ago,
received an unanimous and most honourable expression
of approval from the Conservative Association of this
country, I hope I am not presumptuous if, without now
troubling them for its renewed avowal, I still venture
to count on the continued confidence, which, then, was
so welcome and so cheering.</p>

<p class="center">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Beaconsfield</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The postman who delivered this letter to Mr. Bottomley
offered him all his savings (£19 5s.) for the
letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Bottomley received in five days, in 1879, more
than 3,000 pennies from the working men of Oldham,
together with the personal signature of each contributor,
and he holds Mr. Turnerelli’s receipt for the
£13 5s. he sent him for the tribute.</p>

<p>The wreath was offered to us, and purchased at its
gold valuation.</p>

<p>I looked at it to-day, and renewed my admiration
of its artistic design and remarkable beauty. Every
leaf is of gold, and under each one is inscribed the
name of a town where a committee collected the pennies.
The “tie” bears the inscription “Tracy Turnerelli,
chairman.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE TURNERELLI WREATH</p>

<p class="captionsub">“The People’s Tribute” offered to and
declined by Lord Beaconsfield in 1879.</p>

</div>

<p>While London roared and cynics wrote satirical
quips, the promoter of “The People’s Tribute” took
its rejection very much to heart. I have seen a
cabinet-size photograph of the disappointed sculptor,
taken immediately afterwards, showing him with head
thrown back, resting on his left hand, in a theatrical
posture of profound despair.</p>

<p>Before the Beaconsfield wreath made the name of
Turnerelli a byword, the public-spirited sculptor, who
had spent a long time in Russia, vehemently opposed
the Crimean War, as did also Mr. John Bright. Turnerelli
was received by Lord Aberdeen on the subject,
and the Prime Minister was said to have been impressed
by the sculptor’s sincerity and the cogency of
his arguments. He also saw Lord John Russell, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Foreign Secretary, Lord Clarendon, and Lord Palmerston.
In one particular he was vindicated. He declared
that Cronstadt was impregnable, and as the war
went on this proved to be the case.</p>

<p>Turnerelli, unluckily for himself, thereafter entertained
the chimerical idea of presenting the golden
laurel chaplet to Lord Beaconsfield, estimating that
the cost of each leaf would be about £5. He succeeded,
at any rate, in convincing sceptical people
that there were at least 52,000 Conservative working
men in the country. The wreath was made by Messrs.
Hunt and Roskell, who put it on exhibition at their
rooms. It was also shown to the Prince of Wales
and other members of the Royal Family before being
exhibited at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Turnerelli’s own explanation of Lord Beaconsfield’s
refusal to accept the wreath was a curious one. He
stated that a “high legal functionary” warned Lord
Beaconsfield that the wreath was a typical “Imperial
diadem” which could only be loyally offered to a
sovereign, and that it would be an insult to the Crown
if a subject were to accept such a gift.</p>

<p>This same legal authority, Turnerelli said, reminded
him that the promoter of such a presentation would
have been consigned, in previous reigns, to the Tower
of London.</p>

<p>These warnings came too late for Turnerelli, who,
had he known about them sooner, might have substituted
an inoffensive golden inkstand or a pair of
golden candlesticks. But the wreath was allowed to
go on to completion, to be put on exhibition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to be written about in a light and fleering spirit; while
the statesman to whom it was to be presented offered
no remonstrance until the pennies of the 52,000 working
men had been spent on it.</p>

<p>Flippant people suggested that the whole affair was
a “plant” on Turnerelli’s part to win from Lord Beaconsfield
some honour or emolument; but those who
knew Turnerelli well scouted this insinuation, and
attributed the whole proceeding to the guileless sincerity
of the man.</p>

<p>Had he never embarked upon the wreath project,
he might have preserved some reputation as a writer
of topical political verse and pamphlets. The wreath,
however, may serve to preserve his memory longer, as
an episode in the life of the great Conservative statesman
whom he artlessly, rather than artfully, desired
to honour.</p>

<p>In a curious last will and testament Turnerelli said:
“I leave the gold laurel wreath to the nation, provided
my generous friends the Conservatives will help me
to cover the hundred and fifty pounds or thereabouts
I have personally expended upon it.”</p>

<p>To a Birmingham gentleman, with whom he had
almost completed negotiations for the sale of the wreath
for £245, he wrote: “By the advice of influential
friends I have determined to let Madame Tussaud &amp;
Sons have the privilege of exhibiting the wreath.”
Turnerelli compensated the Birmingham would-be purchaser
for alleged breach of contract.</p>

<p><cite>Punch</cite>, of the 22nd of November, 1879, contained
the following: “What the Wreath has come to.&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
brows of Lord Beaconsfield at Madame Tussaud’s.
<cite>Punch</cite> said it would, and it has.”</p>

<p><cite>Funny Folks</cite> said: “The Beaconsfield Wreath is at
Madame Tussaud’s, probably worn by his lordship’s
effigy. Curious that this emblem of popularity should
be on the wax, while the popularity itself is on the
wane.”</p>

<p>It may be stated that the gold wreath never rested
on the waxen brows of Lord Beaconsfield, despite what
<cite>Punch</cite> said to the contrary.</p>

<p>I am reminded that, in his latter days, Turnerelli
sought consolation for worldly disdain in designing and
constructing his own tombstone. This was erected in
Leamington Cemetery about four years before his
death, and serves as a monument not only for himself,
but also for his father, who was a famous sculptor in
the early part of the century, and is buried in London.</p>

<p>After the erection of the tombstone the younger
Turnerelli regularly went to gaze at it for an hour or
two. The block is surmounted by an imitation in stone
of the famous rejected wreath.</p>

<p>Turnerelli died at Leamington on the 24th of January,
1896, aged eighty-four years.</p>

<p>The requirements of the business have often necessitated
our sending fairly far afield in quest of
exhibits, and this has seldom been done without success,
as people with desirable relics to dispose of appear
to have recognised the claims of Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>Between seven and eight o’clock on Saturday evening,
the 6th of May, 1882, Lord Frederick Cavendish,
the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland,
and Mr. Thomas Burke, the Permanent Irish Under-Secretary,
were stabbed to death in Phœnix Park,
Dublin, and twenty “Invincibles” were subsequently
tried for the murder, five being hanged, three sentenced
to penal servitude for life, and nine to various terms of
imprisonment.</p>

</div>

<p>James Carey, who turned Queen’s evidence and was
acquitted, paid for the betrayal of his associates with
his life, for he was shot by Patrick O’Donnell on board
the <i>Melrose Castle</i>, near Port Elizabeth, South Africa,
on the 24th of July, 1883. The Government, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
efforts to get Carey safely into another part of the
world under an assumed name, were thus outwitted by
the “Invincible” avengers.</p>

<p>It had been intimated to the management of the
Exhibition that there was a chance of Madame Tussaud’s
obtaining from Michael Kavanagh the jaunting-car
in which the assassins drove to and from the
scene of the crime. Kavanagh was a typical Dublin
jarvey, with an almost unintelligible brogue, from
whom the car was hired. The assassins drove several
miles circuitously about the scene of the tragedy with
the object of escaping detection.</p>

<p>Our representative was forthwith sent to Dublin, and
soon found himself in possession of Kavanagh’s car.
The good-humoured jarvey seemed glad to be rid of the
vehicle; anyhow, the price he asked was not a prohibitive
one.</p>

<p>One thing was particularly noticeable, namely, that
the number on the car differed from the number quoted
in the newspaper accounts describing it when taken by
the police. It was discovered, however, that the “Invincibles”
had changed the number before the fateful
journey. A condition was made by Kavanagh that the
pony which drew the car should also be purchased, as
he wished to have done with them both.</p>

<p>It took only a few hours to complete the transaction,
and thereafter Kavanagh drove the purchaser
over the ground traversed by the assassins in their endeavours
to throw the police off the scent. This was
a voluntary act on the part of Kavanagh, and our
representative was curiously exercised at the time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
understand why he imagined the trip should interest
him.</p>

<p>To facilitate transit the car was taken to pieces by
a coach-builder at Kingstown and wrapped in sacking,
in the hope that it would not be observed. It was
then put on the night boat for Holyhead.</p>

<p>The pony found a home in stables belonging to the
Exhibition, and soon afterwards came to an untimely
end from too little exercise and a too liberal allowance
of provender. Why we did not sell the pony for what
it might fetch is more than can be told to-day; it
may be surmised that such an expedient did not occur
to our minds.</p>

<p>On the voyage across passengers whispered to each
other that the Phœnix Park car was on board, and on
its arrival in London there appeared among the latest
telegrams in an evening paper: “Kavanagh’s car goes
to Madame Tussaud’s.” Evidently the Irish correspondents
had wired the news of which we ourselves
had hoped to make a special announcement.</p>

<p>The car was soon put together, and placed on view
at the Exhibition in one of the rooms adjacent to the
Chamber of Horrors, and in another part of the Exhibition
were shown the portraits of Lord Frederick
Cavendish and Mr. Burke.</p>

<p>After being exhibited many years the car was given
to a gentleman who manifested an interest in it. Its
new owner had it renovated for his own use as a private
conveyance, and he might often have been seen driving
it in the streets of London, no one suspecting its notorious
history.</p>

wrath!</p>

<p>I call to mind the visit paid by General Boulanger
shortly after that Meteoric ex-Minister of War quitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Paris for London to avoid arrest. It will be remembered
that Boulanger was wounded in a duel with
Floquet, his political antagonist, and that he dramatically
ended his chequered life by shooting himself on
the grave, in Brussels, of the woman to whom he was
fondly attached.</p>

<p>As we stood before his facsimile, which had been

him as considerably younger than his years, the
General smiled and said, when I invited him to grant
me a special sitting, “It is very, very good; do not

<p>Boulanger’s inclusion at Madame Tussaud’s was the
subject of a full-page cartoon by Tenniel in <cite>Punch</cite>,
showing the be-medalled General standing in his stirrups
on horseback and waving his hand as though in
the act of delivering an important command. The
cartoon was entitled “<i lang="fr">Chez</i> Madame Tussaud’s.” An
Exhibition employé was represented as saying to the
little black-bonneted Madame&mdash;with a covert allusion
to the General’s political reverses&mdash;“Where is he to be
put <em>now</em>, ma’am?”</p>

<p>It was with a certain amount of surprise that I
realised a short time ago, when the question was put
to me by a prominent member of the Press, that during
the thirty years I have been exclusively responsible
for the modelling here, together with the fifteen or
sixteen years in which I was working under my father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
I must have produced, with studies, close upon a thousand
models.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite natural that many celebrities
who pay a visit to the Exhibition, well knowing that
their likenesses, have a place within it, are not escorted
round the galleries. For the most part, coyly and
shyly they seek out their own models, and, more often
than not, approach them with a concern born of a too-studied
indifference that is sometimes extremely amusing.</p>

<p>“Bobs” was not of that order; he was a notable exception
to the general rule.</p>

<p>“Where’s my figure?” he asked plump and plain,
and around it he stepped, quizzically examining it from
various points of view. When he had satisfied himself
that it was a fairly true representation, he ejaculated,
“Not at all bad! Not at all bad!” and walked off to
inspect the relics of the great Napoleon.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts’s figure had been installed soon after
his famous march from Kabul to Khandahar in the
Afghan War.</p>

<p>My favourite portrait&mdash;Lord Tennyson poses unconsciously before
my wife&mdash;“This beats Tussaud’s”&mdash;Sir Richard Burton&mdash;His
widow clothes the model.</p>

</div>

<p>Of all the portraits of my own modelling, I think,
if I may be permitted to express an opinion, I
like that of Lord Tennyson as well as any. It revives
pleasant memories, and I will ask my readers if
I may bring my wife into this part of my story. By
a coincidence, as I raised my eyes at this moment, my
glance fell upon a bust of Tennyson resting on a shelf
in my studio.</p>

<p class="captionsub">The bust modeled by John T. Tussaud, first exhibited at the Royal
Academy, London, in 1892, now in the Tussaud collection.</p>

</div>

<p>About the time when I was engaged with the model
of the great Victorian poet I had rented a farm cottage
near Freshwater, Isle of Wight, and I remember
my wife telling me that she frequently saw Tennyson
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On several occasions the poet, who lived at Farringford,
near by, while taking his daily constitutional,
came and leant upon the garden gate, evidently
charmed with the beauty of the place. The old
thatched roof and the quaint attractiveness of the cottage
might well have given rise to reflections in less
imaginative minds than that of a poet.</p>

<p>I had not the opportunity of studying Tennyson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
features at that time; but my wife, coyly hidden in
a favourite spot in the garden, was able to observe
him closely. Being herself an artist of no mean ability,
she thus afforded me considerable help in the production
of his portrait.</p>

<p>It seems strange that perhaps the most reclusive
of men should have unwittingly come forward and
posed, as it were, at the very door of the artist who
was then desirous of obtaining sittings.</p>

<p>One day, while I was at work in the studio on
Tennyson, I was visited by Father Haythornthwaite,
rector of the Catholic Church at Freshwater. The
priest was greatly interested, and he must have conveyed
to the poet the intelligence that I was about
to place his figure in Madame Tussaud’s, for very
shortly afterwards I learned that Tennyson was particularly
desirous that I should bear in mind that, in
spite of his four-score years, he had not a grey hair
in his head&mdash;a touch of nature that seemed to me particularly
human.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A nice but unintentional compliment was paid to
one of our tableaux about this time by the present
King, when he was Duke of York. We complied with
a request to furnish a representation of the scene of
the death of Nelson in the cockpit of the <i>Victory</i> for
the Royal Naval Exhibition at Chelsea in May, 1891.
This tableau was founded on the famous picture by
Devis, which found a permanent home at Greenwich
Hospital in 1825; and it was very well received by
the visitors to the Exhibition. The compliment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
which I allude was not heard by me, but it was reported
in the Press at the time that the Duke of York,
while looking at the tableau, exclaimed, “Why, this
beats Tussaud’s!”</p>

<p>The tableau has been in our Exhibition ever since,
and is a great favourite with all. When the present
Prince of Wales and his brother Albert paid us a visit,
the Sailor Prince looked long and intently at the historic
scene. Both boys were also a good deal moved
as they gazed on the tableau showing the murder of
the two little princes in the Tower of London&mdash;a representation
over which many impressionable people
have been unable to keep dry eyes.</p>

<p class="caption">SIR RICHARD BURTON</p>

<p class="captionsub">The effigy dressed in the clothes he wore on his famous pilgrimage
to Mecca, modeled by John T. Tussaud.</p>

</div>

<p>A great name with the past generation was that of
Sir Richard Burton, who, sixty-six years ago, in fulfilment
of a lifelong dream, made a pilgrimage to the
shrine of the prophet Mahomet at Mecca when it was
believed that no Christian could go there. Besides
being a great explorer he was a man of scholarly attainments,
and his translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
bears the stamp of an intimate familiarity with the
Orient.</p>

<p>When Sir Richard died his remarkable career became
so much a subject of general comment in the
Press that the British public awakened to the fact
that a great Englishman had just passed away.</p>

<p>Apart from his literary achievements, the account
of his exploits revealed so great a love of adventure
and so much disregard for narrowing conventionalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as to leaven the story of his life with a very strong
tincture of romance.</p>

<p>When modelling his figure I saw a great deal of his
handsome and stately widow, and I am sure no woman
could have taken a greater pleasure or more pains
in assisting an artist with such an undertaking. Every
thought, every action, she bestowed upon the work
showed how deeply she cherished her husband’s memory
and how vividly the portrait stirred her imagination.</p>

<p>She clothed the model with perhaps the greatest
personal treasure of his she possessed&mdash;that is to say,
the actual garments her husband wore when he went
on his famous pilgrimage to Mecca. She tarried long
over the finishing touches that should make his presentment
look its best before the critical eyes of the public
should scan it. Ornaments, beads, trappings, had
each her full consideration, and the very weapons of
defence stuck anglewise in his belt were subjected to
her most careful arrangement.</p>

<p>Of the capacity for taking pains there was no limit
in Isabel Lady Burton’s nature; but the labour in producing
the figure, after many trying weeks, at last
came to an end; and there readily springs to my mind
the pathetic picture of her bestowing upon the figure
the few final touches, her fingers lingering over the
pleats and folds of his robe ere she could declare herself
satisfied that the task she had undertaken in helping
with the model had been done at her very best.</p>

<p>There was one little difficulty, however, that she
could not quite surmount. The costume was complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in every respect except one&mdash;the sandals he had worn
on his hazardous journey to Mecca had become, owing
to the wet and heat and the passage of time, mere
tinder, and could not be placed upon the figure.</p>

<p>The following brief but interesting letter explains
how this difficulty was overcome:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>67, Baker Street, Portman Square, W., May 22nd, 1894.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Tussaud</span>,</p>

<p>I sent you a pair of sandals yesterday belonging to
me, but to-day I have had the promise of a pair from
the Prior of the Franciscans which would suit much better.
I shall send them directly I receive them.</p>

<p>Removal of the Exhibition to the present building&mdash;Sleeping “figures”&mdash;History
of the Portman Rooms&mdash;The Cato Street Conspiracy&mdash;Baron
Grant’s staircase.</p>

</div>

<p>After fifty prosperous years at the old Baker
Street Rooms&mdash;now known as the Portman
Rooms&mdash;it became necessary that Madame Tussaud’s
should find more commodious premises to meet the
growing popularity of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The removal to the present well-known red building
was made in July, 1884, and the change took about
a week, during which the staff put in very long hours.
So strenuous a time was it that some of them could
hardly keep their eyes open towards the end of this
transition period.</p>

<p>There were considerably more than four hundred
figures, not to mention countless other things, to transfer;
and the models were cloaked for conveyance, as
the idea could not be entertained of portraits of royalties,
celebrities, and notorieties being carried uncovered
and exposed to the vulgar gaze.</p>

<p>The wrapping of the images in sheets led to an amusing
incident after they had been removed. Before
they could be properly arranged and a fitting place assigned
to each, the exhibits were placed in their coverings
on the floor. This fact, it appeared, suggested
to tired members of the staff a way by which they
might be able to snatch a little rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Missing some of the men, my suspicions were directed
to the prostrate exhibits, and I proceeded to prod
the sheeted figures, with the result that here and there
my attentions called forth manifestations of life. The
weary helpers had laid themselves down to sleep among
the models, hoping not to be disturbed. Although
time was pressing, they were permitted to continue a
few hours’ well-earned rest with their pack-sheet cloaks
around them.</p>

<p>Few of our visitors on the closing night were aware
of the forthcoming change-over, and it was only when
the band, after playing the last bar of the National
Anthem, struck up “Auld Lang Syne” that the visitors
realised what it all signified. There was a touch of
pathos in the farewell scenes, and for the next week
Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition was not included among
the sights of London.</p>

<p>When the old rooms in Baker Street were taken
over for hospital uses in the war, my mind reverted
to an historic coincidence of considerable military interest.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago what is now the
Baker Street Carriage Bazaar formed the barracks and
stabling of the Royal Life Guards. The place was
then known as the King Street Barracks. Old inhabitants
of the neighbourhood used to tell me that
a regiment of the Guards marched from these quarters
on their way to the field of Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>A little way off was the Portman Street Barracks,
from which Captain Fitzclarence set out to arrest
Arthur Thistlewood and his confederates in connection
with the Cato Street Conspiracy&mdash;one of the most
desperate and foolhardy episodes in modern English
history.</p>

<p>Thistlewood and other members of the Spencean
Society&mdash;which might almost be described as the prototype
of latter-day Bolshevism&mdash;conceived the mad
idea that they could capture, among other strongholds,
the Bank of England, the Mansion House, the Tower
of London, and Coutts’s Bank; but they found that the
public sympathy on which they counted did not exist.
Thistlewood was thrown into gaol for treasonable utterances,
and instead of imprisonment bringing him
to his right senses, he became more fanatical than
ever.</p>

<p>The crowning act of infamy on the part of this
nineteenth-century “Guy Fawkes” and his followers
was to hatch a plot for the assassination of Ministers
at a Cabinet dinner in Lord Harrowby’s house, Grosvenor
Square. The conspirators took a loft over a
stable in Cato Street, Marylebone, where they accumulated
arms, bombs, and hand-grenades, vainly imagining
that the police knew nothing of their movements,
whereas the authorities were only waiting the right
moment for action.</p>

<p>Thistlewood and his gang of desperadoes were arrested
in the act of arming themselves for the wholesale
assassination of the heads of the Government. In
the scuffle Thistlewood killed a police-officer with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sword. The ringleader and four others, named Brunt,
Davidson, Ings, and Tidd, were executed on the evidence
of one of their own associates, who told the
court that it was intended, in the first instance, to set
fire to the King Street Barracks and either take the
Life Guardsmen prisoners or kill them as they sat in
their mess-room. This mess-room, fifteen years later,
was occupied by Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Few, if any, of the thousands of persons who mount
and descend the marble staircase which adorns the entrance-hall
of Madame Tussaud’s are aware that it
originally formed part of a lordly pleasure house which
was erected by the late Baron Grant on the site of
what was one of the vilest slums (then known as
“The Rookery”) in Kensington.</p>

<p>Who was Baron Grant?</p>

<p>The late Baron was born in Dublin in 1830. His
real name, it appears, was Gottheimer. His parents
were poor, and he had a hard upbringing. By dint,
however, of industry, the sharpness of his wits and
his great aptitude for business, he acquired wealth and
a reputation in the City of London.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-five he was elected M.P. for
Kidderminster, standing as a Liberal-Conservative and
defeating Lord Annaly, who was at that time a Lord
of the Treasury. In 1868 he was appointed a Deputy-Lieutenant
of the Tower Hamlets, and in the same
year the King of Italy conferred upon him the hereditary
dignity of Baron and appointed him a Commander
of the Order of St. Maurice and Lazare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>These distinctions were well deserved by the then
Mr. Grant for the services he had rendered in connection
with the completion of the famous Victor Emmanuel
Gallery in Milan, though in one of the burlesques
of the period the decoration was scathingly referred
to in the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Kings can titles give, but honour can’t,</div>
<div class="verse">So title without honour’s but a <em>barren Grant</em>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the height of his prosperity Baron Grant built
his princely mansion at Kensington Gore. It was never
occupied, except for one night, when the “bachelors of
London”&mdash;in other words, the smart young men of
London Society&mdash;hired the house from the Baron’s
creditors and gave a ball of exceptional splendour.</p>

<p>The Baron was unable to pay the contractor, and
the mansion, known as “Grant’s Folly,” was pulled
down because no one could afford to buy or rent it.
The magnificent marble staircase, which cost £11,000,
was bought by Madame Tussaud’s for £1,000, and
placed in our Exhibition.</p>

<p>The beautiful iron railings and gates of the “Folly”
were purchased for the Sandown Park Club, where, I
understand, they may still be seen.</p>

<p>Baron Grant was a keen collector of works of art,
and once obtained the honour of being voted the
thanks of the House of Commons for presenting a
picture to the National Gallery.</p>

<p>It came about in this way:</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, 1874, a very valuable portrait
of Sir Walter Scott was put up to auction at Christie’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and was eventually secured by Baron Grant for 800
guineas. The same evening Sir Stafford Northcote, the
Leader of the House, was asked by a private member
why the Government had not purchased so fine a work
of art for the nation. He replied that the Treasury
had no funds available for the outlay. Thereupon
the Baron rose and stated that he had already written
offering the picture to the Trustees of the National
Gallery.</p>

<p>Sir Stafford immediately proposed a vote of thanks,
and this was carried with much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Eight hundred guineas, however, was far from being
the largest sum which the Baron spent on a single
picture. He gave £10,000 for Landseer’s “Otter
Hunt,” and the value of his collection may be judged
from the fact that it realised £106,000 when the inevitable
crash came and his art treasures passed under
the hammer to pay his creditors.</p>

<p>The great benefaction for which Baron Grant will
always be remembered is the gift of Leicester Square
to the Metropolis at a cost to him of upwards of
£30,000. For years this Square had been dilapidated
and a disgrace to London, with a huge hoarding round
it. Baron Grant secured, by purchase, all the rights
of the owners. He then planted the gardens, and
erected in the centre the statue of Shakespeare by Signor
Fontana. This was, at the time, the only statue
of the world’s greatest dramatist existing out of doors
in his own country. The liberal donor also placed in
the Square busts of celebrated men who had lived in
the neighbourhood. These included Sir Isaac Newton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
John Hunter, William Hogarth, and Sir Joshua
Reynolds.</p>

<p>This act of munificence did not bring the Baron the
popularity he so much desired, for after the princely
gift was presented by him to the Metropolitan Board
of Works on the 2nd of July, 1874, the following
verses were freely sold at the opening ceremony:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of course, you’ve heard the news that Baron Grant,</div>
<div class="verse">To gain what most he wants&mdash;a good repute,</div>
<div class="verse">Has promised to reclaim</div>
<div class="verse">Wild Leicester Square, so long the West End’s shame,</div>
<div class="verse">And turn that waste ground, nigh Alhambra’s towers,</div>
<div class="verse">Into a smiling garden full of flowers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But will the world forget these flowers of Grant’s</div>
<div class="verse">Are but the product of his City “plants”?</div>
<div class="verse">And who, for shady walks, will give him praise</div>
<div class="verse">For wealth thus spent, <em>when gained in shady ways</em>?</div>
<div class="verse">In short, what can he hope from this affair?</div>
<div class="verse">Save to connect his name with one thing Square!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was this same public-spirited though erratic
“plunger” in stocks and shares who, in February, 1875,
widened, at his own cost, the road leading to Kensington
House, so as to avoid the curve which was
dangerous to carriages when driving in. It was an
approach that Queen Victoria frequently used.</p>

<p>King of Siam’s visit&mdash;The Shahzada’s clothing&mdash;King of Burmah’s
war elephant&mdash;Tale of two monkeys.</p>

</div>

<p>The King of Siam and the Shahzada of Afghanistan
are linked in my memory because of the
peculiar interest King Chulalongkorn took in the Afghan
Prince, whose model appeared in all the splendour
of one of the Shahzada’s own State dresses.</p>

<p>The moment the King of Siam was confronted by
this portrait he exclaimed in surprise:</p>

<p>“How did the uniform come here? Where did you
get it?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I replied, “we purchased it.”</p>

<p>“Whom did you get it from?” the King of Siam
persisted. “From the Shahzada himself?”</p>

<p>The information was imparted that the elaborate
costume had been offered to us by a member of the
Shahzada’s suite, who took a keen personal interest in
the transaction, and gave us to understand that his
royal master would prefer that the portrait should
not wear his own clothes till after his departure from
this country.</p>

<p>We complied with this condition, and while writing
these reminiscences the gorgeous apparel of the Afghan
Prince lies heaped in a corner of my studio, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
been brought out that I may again for a moment gaze
upon its faded glories of purple and gold; for the portrait
of the Shahzada has long since been removed from
its pedestal.</p>

<p>The King of Siam was a very decorous and unassuming
little gentleman, who gave no hint of disappointment
that his own portrait did not appear in the
collection, while I wondered, as I walked with him,
whether he regretted or welcomed the omission.</p>

<p>As we came face to face with the Shah of Persia,
whose gorgeous habiliments glittered with a veritable
firmament of jewels, the King again harped upon the
question of the Shahzada’s clothes.</p>

<p>Looking hard at the “lion” of a former season, the
King exclaimed:</p>

<p>“His own clothes, too, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not this time,” I replied. “We were not so fortunate
in the case of the Shah.”</p>

<p>“An exact duplicate, though,” was the compliment
of the laughing King.</p>

<p>The Eastern potentate was a most minute and intelligent
observer of all he saw, and questioned me unceasingly.</p>

<p>“Who is that beside the Prince?” he inquired, pointing
at the Prince of Wales in a howdah on the back
of the elephant Juno, a tableau which depicted a
tiger-hunting incident in the late King Edward’s Indian
tour.</p>

<p>On being told that the Prince was accompanied by
his “loader,” the King replied, “Yes, yes,” as if he
thought his question a superfluous one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>From hall to hall we passed, and I was astonished
at the knowledge of English history displayed by King
Chulalongkorn. He picked out the figure of Richard I,
and, pointing to the white doublet with the red cross
on the breast, said, “The costume of a Crusader&mdash;certainly,
certainly.” The representation of King John
with the Magna Charta in his hand did not appear to
produce a very pleasing impression upon the Siamese
autocrat.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> a name! Who was he?” remarked the King
in front of Houqua, the big Chinaman who earned his
place in the Exhibition on account of certain services
he had rendered this country. I had withdrawn for a
moment, and was called back to explain that Houqua
was a Chinese merchant, whereat the royal interlocutor
turned away with a contempt for trade clearly indicated
on his face.</p>

<p>It was surprising to note that King Chulalongkorn
passed the portraits of Mr. Gladstone, Lord Salisbury,
and other British statesmen without a pause or comment.
He stood some minutes in front of the case
containing the orders of the Duke of Wellington, and
then remarked, with admiring emphasis:</p>

<p>“These are surely all the orders a man could have;
he must have had nearly everything.”</p>

<p>The group of Henry VIII and his six wives was
surveyed in stolid silence by a monarch not likely to
be moved by such a spectacle. In a shadowed portion
of the gallery he nearly mistook (and slightly frightened)
two nice English girls in white for wax figures.</p>

<p>In the Chamber of Horrors he showed from his observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that he was familiar with the main features
of several of the crimes commemorated there.</p>

<p>I may add that every honour was done the King
on that occasion. We had the public excluded from
the Exhibition, and the Siamese National Anthem was
played on his arrival and departure.</p>

<p>The King of Siam’s inspection of the elephant reminds
me that, beside the stuffed monkey which one
of the wives of Henry VIII is fondling, the only animals
ever shown in the Exhibition were in the “Tiger
Hunt” scene in question. The tusker was the famous
Juno, which was for many years the King of Burmah’s
war elephant.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales had just mortally wounded a
male tiger, and was about to give the <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i> to
another beast which, unexpectedly springing from the
jungle, had been pinned to the ground by Juno. The
animals were stuffed and staged by the late Mr. Rowland
Ward.</p>

<p>When I say that these were the only animals shown
in the Exhibition I mean, of course, dead ones.</p>

<p>Within the past twelve months a monkey that escaped
from the Zoo, barely a mile away, entered the
Exhibition by a back window, and was seen in the
act by a crowd of people, who had been amused by
its antics outside.</p>

<p>It appears that the monkey, in scurrying through
the building, caught sight of its dead counterpart on
the lap of Henry’s Queen, and tried to attract its
attention. Failing in this, the little creature pawed
it, and the result was electrical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>The strangeness of coming unexpectedly in contact
with a dead animal which was thought to be alive
seems to have startled the monkey beyond measure, for
it became terrified, and, springing away, went at great
speed to the remotest part of the Exhibition, where
it took refuge in one of the side rooms.</p>

<p>Several visitors, mostly ladies, were in the room at
the time, and they at once made for the door, which
was thereupon locked upon the animal. Meanwhile
we had telephoned to the Zoo that one of the monkeys
had escaped and was in the Exhibition.</p>

<p>A keeper arrived shortly afterwards, and said he
had missed it from its cage. Both keeper and monkey
were delighted at their reunion. The monkey had not
seemed to trouble much about the figures, which it
probably took for living people, but the dead monkey
on the lap of one of them had been more than it could
stand.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria’s copperplates&mdash;Another Royal Persian visit&mdash;“Perished
by fire”&mdash;“Viscount Hinton” and his organ&mdash;The Coquette’s
jewels lost and found.</p>

</div>

<p>In the early part of 1898 we purchased from an
enterprising journalist four interesting copperplates&mdash;three
of them etched by Queen Victoria and one
by the Prince Consort. Of the four plates, three were
done by the Queen within a year of her marriage.</p>

<p>Although not altogether faultless from an artistic
point of view, the work is most conscientiously executed,
showing how painstaking was the Queen even
in comparatively trivial matters.</p>

<p>After her marriage Her Majesty found in the Prince
Consort a fellow craftsman, and forthwith a room in
Buckingham Palace was fitted up as a sort of combination
studio and workshop. Here, under the guidance
and advice of Sir Edwin Landseer, assisted by
Mr. Henry Graves, the fine art publisher, the young
couple worked for two or three hours in the morning.</p>

<p>Nor would the Queen allow any portion of the process
to be performed by an assistant. Even the printing
was done either by herself or her husband, a small
press being set up for that especial purpose.</p>

<p>It is understood that portraits of the royal children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thus reproduced are preserved in the print-room at
Windsor Castle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have already described how the Shah of Persia
(Nasr-ed-Din) paid a private visit to the Exhibition in
the year 1873.</p>

<p>I must now relate the circumstances that attended
the visit of his son, Muzafir-ed-Din, who came to
this country for the coronation of King Edward in
1902, thirty years later.</p>

<p>The “Brother of the Sun” came on the 19th of
August. He was attended by the Earl of Kintore
and Sir Arthur Hardinge, and I received His Majesty,
while the orchestra played the Persian National Anthem.</p>

<p>The first model he asked to see was that of his
late father, but unfortunately his picturesque parent
had disappeared to make room for more up-to-date people.</p>

<p>The horrible fact of the remelting to cast a possibly
much less distinguished personage could not, of course,
be divulged to the royal visitor. A hint to the entourage
was sufficient. “<em>Perished by fire&mdash;great accidental
fire</em>,” explained Sir Arthur Hardinge with the
aplomb of a true diplomat. “<em>Big fire</em>,” echoed the
sombre Persians sadly in their own tongue.</p>

<p>The Shah listened to a description of the models
in French and made his comments in Persian, a course
of procedure which was not helpful to those who would
have liked to glean His Majesty’s impressions.</p>

<p>By this time the news that the Shah was in the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had spread, and the people began to throng around
him. It was difficult to say whether he appreciated
the curiosity of the crowd or not. A merry little party
of Japs beamed upon the dusky potentate from the Far
East, and the two extremities of Asia thus metaphorically
rubbed shoulders.</p>

<p>The tableau of “Queen Victoria at Home” pleased
the Eastern sovereign most. He looked at it longest.</p>

<p>The scene depicting the Gordon Highlanders storming
the Heights of Dargai also captivated him. The
place where the battle was fought was not very remote
from the borders of His Majesty’s dominions, and
he was, no doubt, familiar with the history of the wild
tribesmen of the north-west frontier of India. He was
an eager auditor while the Gay Gordons’ feat was narrated
in French and Persian.</p>

<p>Face to face with his own portrait model, the Shah
addressed some presumably humorous remark to it, for
sovereign and suite relaxed their facial muscles simultaneously,
and a Persian outburst of mirth succeeded.
<em>The stolid monarch actually laughed outright.</em> It
was the only recorded laugh of His Majesty during
his visit to this country.</p>

<p>But what did he say to that waxen presentment?
The features of the model were certainly rather darker
than those of the Shah, but the observation in Persian
of the monarch was darker still&mdash;at any rate to me.
Turning aside, he remarked, in French, that though the
features were excellent, the complexion was not quite
fair enough&mdash;a disclosure of an undoubted Eastern
vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>He closely scrutinised the figures of reigning sovereigns,
and on coming to that of the young Queen
of Holland he exclaimed, in French, “Ah, I have seen
Her Majesty.” The Shah quickly noticed Mr. Balfour
among the group of politicians, and gazed eagerly
at the representation of the meeting between Lord
Roberts and Cronje at Paardeberg.</p>

<p class="caption">THE SURRENDER OF GENERAL CRONJE TO LORD ROBERTS</p>

<p class="captionsub">A Boer War tableau modeled by John T. Tussaud.</p>

</div>

<p>Whether the Shah was made nervous through the
proximity of the crowd, I cannot say, but he neglected
to visit the Chamber of Horrors and the Napoleonic
relics (which latter he had expressed a desire to see),
and made a straight line for the exit before those who
were chaperoning him realised the meaning of the
movement.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Horrors would have been an attraction
to at least one member of the suite. This
gentleman was fascinated by the group in the Hall of
Tableaux representing the execution of Mary, Queen
of Scots. He stood gazing with dilated eyes upon the
scene, and had to be called on by a touch on the arm
before he could be made to realise the unreality of
the drama.</p>

<p class="caption">VISCOUNT HINTON</p>

<p class="captionsub">The wax figure on exhibition at Madame Tussaud’s dressed in subject’s
own clothes and shown with the organ used by this eccentric
gentleman on his organ-grinding career.</p>

</div>

<p>At an Exhibition supper at which “Viscount Hinton”
was present, we having modelled his figure and
purchased his organ on the death of the old Earl, to
which title he now laid claim, a speaker, in proposing
my health, began “Mr. Chairman, my Lord, Ladies and
Gentlemen.” That was enough for “Earl Poulett.”
He rose and bowed in recognition of the compliment
paid to his degree, and when the speaker finished he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
made a speech in which he referred to a few incidents
in his organ-grinding career.</p>

<p>He sat to me for his model, and we bought the suit
of clothes he was wearing, although a friend of his
told his “lordship” that he would not have picked
them up from the gutter.</p>

<p>It appears that “Hinton” went to the Bank of England
with the £50 note we gave him, and, as is customary,
he was asked to sign his name. With a flourish
he wrote down “Poulett,” whereupon the cashier said,
“Christian name as well, please.” Hinton drew himself
up and said, “We earls always sign our names
like that,” a remark which, doubtless, duly impressed
and abashed the cashier.</p>

<p>In June, 1901, as the Exhibition was closing for
the day, several pieces of jewellery, valued at between
50 and 60 guineas, were discovered to be missing
from the figure of the Old Coquette, facing the
model of the sardonic but courtier-like Voltaire, who
is seen raising his hat to her. The gems had served
to adorn the representation of this curious-looking old
dame for a period of more than a century.</p>

<p>As soon as the discovery was made the usual notification
was given to the police. Strange to say,
while the detective-officer was in consultation with
us discussing the most likely means of recovering the
articles, a bulky envelope, bearing the mark of the
Earl’s Court postal district, was handed in containing
the missing property, with the following short
note enclosed: “Found at Madame Tussaud’s&mdash;thrown
down.”</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Royal visitors&mdash;King Alphonso and Princess Ena&mdash;The late Emperor
Frederick&mdash;A penniless trio&mdash;Princess Charles&mdash;The Prince of
Wales and Prince Albert.</p>

</div>

<p>Madame Tussaud’s was one of the last
places visited by the King of Spain and Princess
Ena before they left this country for their wedding
at Madrid in May, 1906.</p>

<p>Somehow there seemed to be at the time an atmosphere
of anxiety attending the visit of this vivacious
royal couple, and I feel sure this uneasiness was felt
by many who observed them pass freely and jocularly
among the visitors, who were very numerous that afternoon
in the Exhibition rooms. Disquieting rumours
had reached this country that an attempt would be
made by certain disaffected ruffians to interfere with
their marriage. Plots and threats of a sinister character
were in the air, and, as we all know, these culminated
in a crime of a particularly atrocious nature
in the Spanish capital.</p>

<p>Yet none seemed to be less affected by these disturbing
influences than the young royalties themselves,
while I am quite certain neither of them was acting
a part. They were simply as happy as a bride and
bridegroom ought to be who were counting the days
till they should be united.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The young King took a positive delight in moving
among the visitors, and none was less self-conscious
than he. I was amused to find him bubbling over
with fun and frolic standing in front of his own portrait.</p>

<p>Then he did the thing one almost expected he would
do. To the amusement of all beholders he exclaimed,
“Let me shake hands with myself,” suiting the action
to the words, and laughing heartily with his bride
and her friends. It is for traits like this that King
Alphonso enjoys popularity wherever he goes.</p>

<p>The visit passed off happily, and I for one felt
somewhat relieved when they had taken their departure
without molestation, although I had no tangible
reason to harbour the doubts that possessed me.</p>

<p>On returning to this country soon after the tragic
accompaniments of their marriage, the light-hearted
young King took an early opportunity of revisiting
the Exhibition, and in passing gave a familiar nod of
recognition at his own portrait, as one might salute
an acquaintance in the street.</p>

<p>He roamed about the place in the least ostentatious
way, and took a noticeably keen interest in the
figure of the great Duke of Wellington, who, among
his numerous foreign honours, received the titles of
Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo and a Grandee of the first
class, 1812&mdash;titles granted by predecessors of King
Alphonso on the Spanish throne. As was the case
with the King of Spain and his bride, members of
the Royal Family on numerous occasions have paid
their shillings and gone in “with the crowd,” their object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
being to stroll round without having to undergo
the worry of a “reception” and its attendant red
baize and “blowing of trumpets.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after his marriage with our then Princess Royal,
the late Emperor Frederick of Germany, who was at
that time Prince Frederick of Prussia, decided to pay
us a visit. This was rather more than fifty years
ago.</p>

<p>Hearing of his intention, my father decided to
withdraw his figure, deeming it to be too youthful
and out-of-date to bear a favourable comparison with
its living counterpart&mdash;a severe test for even the best
of portraits.</p>

<p>When the Prince arrived it appeared that he had
come with the main object of inspecting his own model,
for he had not been long in the place before he exclaimed,
“Where is my figure?”</p>

<p>This was a question that rather nonplussed the
member of my family who had undertaken to cicerone
His Royal Highness through the Exhibition.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to make the plain,
straightforward admission that it had only just been
removed, and to give the reason for this having been
done.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the Prince’s request to view
the portrait was reiterated, and he was so emphatic
and persistent that there was nothing to be done but
to replace the figure before his very eyes.</p>

<p>It was a strange proceeding, that of having to withdraw
the model from the side room into which it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
been removed, to march it through the spacious galleries
with the Prince amusedly looking on the while,
and ultimately to dump it down in its old place among
the figures in our big royal group.</p>

<p>The Prince, with great good-humour, scanned it
with a lenient eye, and pronounced it to be by no
means a portrait of which anyone need be ashamed;
in fact, he appeared quite pleased with it, and when
he left the Exhibition he seemed to be highly delighted
with his unique and interesting experience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many years ago, in the late seventies, Alexander
III of Russia (then the Tsarevitch), accompanied by
the Tsarevna and her sister, the Princess of Wales,
visited the Exhibition in Baker Street.</p>

<p>On reaching the entrance to the Napoleon Rooms
and the Chamber of Horrors, where an extra admission
fee of sixpence is charged, my uncle, who was standing
near, heard the Tsarevitch say to his companions
that he had no money.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales was obliged to admit that
she was in the same penniless plight, while the Tsarevna
exclaimed with emphasis, “<i lang="fr">Et moi aussi; je n’ai
pas un penny dans ma poche!</i>”</p>

<p>Here, then, it may be said, was a trio of monarchs-to-be
in the amusing predicament of not having a
sixpence among the three of them!</p>

<p>My uncle was bound to respect the royal visitors’
incognito, and so could not venture to “pass them
in,” which, of course, he would have been very proud
and happy to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty was overcome by one of the gentlemen
in attendance on the royal party, who came up
shortly afterwards and produced the necessary fees.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Princess Charles of Denmark is reported to have
said many years ago, “I sometimes get tired of being
a royal, especially when I am looked at and wondered
at as though I were one of Madame Tussaud’s wax
models. I even think how glorious it must be to be
able to jump on the top of a ’bus, pay my fare like
any ordinary person, and have a day out. I have
never tried to do so yet, but I think I shall some day.”</p>

<p>Mention of this brings to my mind one of several
visits paid to the Exhibition by the Princes of our
own Royal House.</p>

<p>I was notified by telephone that the present Prince
of Wales and his brother, Prince Albert, were visiting
the Exhibition. They were received by me, and I
conducted them over the place.</p>

<p>The royal boys needed very little “conducting,”
as they were soon engrossed in all they saw around
them, and seldom found it necessary to address any
questions to me.</p>

<p>I was amused to find that they preferred to dispense
with the Catalogue, taking a boyish delight in recognising
the figures for themselves and displaying what
knowledge they possessed, which was considerable.
Nor did they seem in the least concerned to know
whether members of the general public recognised
them, as I could see many did from the way they
contrived to keep near to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Napoleonic relics the Princes lingered
an unusually long time, as if reluctant to leave them;
and the Prince of Wales betrayed so much interest in
the carriage in which Napoleon was all but captured
after the Battle of Waterloo that he was invited to
sit in it, if he cared. Without a moment’s hesitation
he embraced the opportunity, and his brother joined
him.</p>

<p>It happened that we were just then about to have
the carriage glazed in, as it has been since, to protect
it from ruthless souvenir hunters, whose mutilations
necessitated our keeping in stock rolls of cloth of the
same pattern to renew the lining from time to time.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people in different parts of the
world now show their friends strips of cloth purporting
to be taken from the original lining of the Napoleon
carriage, whereas the “souvenirs” are really “relics” of
the looms of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The last to sit in Napoleon’s carriage were the Prince
of Wales and Prince Albert.</p>

<p>The Begum of Bhopal pays us a visit&mdash;Lord Rosebery and Lord
Annaly&mdash;Lord Randolph Churchill&mdash;Lady Beatty, Lady Jellicoe,
and Mrs. Asquith.</p>

</div>

<p>It was on the 29th of June, eight years ago, that we
had a visit from the Begum of Bhopal, a lady who
rules over millions in India.</p>

<p>She was in London for the coronation of King
George and Queen Mary. As the Begum was a Moslem,
we were somewhat concerned as to how we should
receive Her Highness, it being rumoured that she could
not be chaperoned by one of the opposite sex. I must
deny the story that we had to turn all the males out of
the Exhibition, for there was no occasion to do so.</p>

<p>The Begum was dressed in brown, with a flowing
white yashmak hanging from a quaint head-dress
shaped like a top-hat of the Leech period. This veil,
by the etiquette of her country, is worn in the company
of men, the wearer looking through two eye-holes.</p>

<p>In order that the exhibits might be explained to her,
my wife and a friend of hers, Mrs. Arthur Dulcken,
who spoke Hindustani fluently, acted as guides. Two
turbaned gentlemen were in attendance, and the Begum
walked between her little grandson and granddaughter,
whose hands she held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Her knowledge of English history was surprising.
Even the Prince, who was only six years old, prattled
about different English kings, though he insisted that
the good King Alfred, shown in the neatherd’s cottage,
where he is being rated by the shrew for allowing her
cakes to burn, was a fairy-tale like that of the Sleeping
Beauty.</p>

<p>When the party came to the Grand Hall in which
King George and Queen Mary sat arrayed in their
coronation robes, with six Princesses of the Royal
House standing around them, “Bara Salaam,” said the
Begum, as she bowed to the Emperor of India.</p>

<p>Before the scene which shows Queen Victoria receiving
the news of her accession to the throne the little
lady halted.</p>

<p>“She was very beautiful,” she said, “and so wise and
kind and sympathetic.”</p>

<p>It was the tribute of one woman ruler to another.</p>

<p>“She was very beautiful,” she said again, “and so
small. In Bhopal we think small people beautiful.”</p>

<p>The Begum’s inches were some sixty-two.</p>

<p>She glanced approvingly at the model of Tom
Thumb, and proudly placed her grandson by the figure
of the Russian giant to accentuate her admiration
for small people.</p>

<p>As she passed through the Chamber of Horrors, with
its guillotine and gallows, she said, with some degree
of satisfaction, “We do not execute in Bhopal.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she said, as she departed in state;
and her retainers added an official word of praise:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
“The Begum has found Madame Tussaud’s extremely
interesting.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord Rosebery has more than once visited Madame
Tussaud’s, and made a fairly long stay on each occasion.</p>

<p>Only very recently he and Lord Annaly, Lord-in-Waiting
to the King, came to the Exhibition together.
Our lecturer happened to notice them among the visitors
in the building, and observed the two noblemen
makes a careful inspection of the exhibits, conversing
in a lively manner, and occasionally calling each other’s
attention to models which struck them as being
specially interesting.</p>

<p>It is, of course, difficult to judge whether they were
prompted by any particular motive, or paid the visit
merely to enjoy a few minutes’ respite from the more
serious affairs of life; but they both minutely examined
the relics of the French Revolution and, curiously
enough, the figures of the criminals in the Chamber of
Horrors, where they spent some considerable time.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery, as a citizen of Edinburgh, called
his friend’s attention to the striking figures of Burke
and Hare, with the story of whose crimes Lord Rosebery
must, of course, have been familiar. These
ghoulish men perpetrated a series of murders in the
Scottish capital in the year 1828 for the purpose of
obtaining money by selling the bodies to anatomical
schools as subjects for dissection.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that the verb “to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
burke” is derived from the villainous miscreant of that
name.</p>

<p>One would like to have heard what passed between
Lord Rosebery and Lord Annaly as, having left the
abode of criminals, they stopped in front of the former’s
portrait in the main hall of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>As they were leaving the building our representative,
as an act of courtesy, opened the middle gate to
let them pass with greater freedom, and, in doing so,
said, “Good-night, my lord.” Lord Rosebery smiled
in response like one who is pleased at being recognised.
It was evident from their demeanour that both the peers
had enjoyed their experience.</p>

<p>Lord Randolph Churchill once said that the two
proudest moments in his life were neither his first
election to Parliament nor his first appearance on the
Treasury Bench, but the publication of a speech of his
in leaflet form and the appearance of his effigy at
Madame Tussaud’s. He added that he had long wished
to see how he looked there, but had never dared to
go. Notwithstanding this remark he was seen in the
flesh on more than one occasion at a later date sauntering
through the Exhibition rooms.</p>

<p>That the wives of famous men invariably feel curious
to see the models of their husbands goes without
saying, and very many instances might be cited of their
having done so. Among those who visited the Exhibition
during the war were Lady Jellicoe, Lady Beatty,
and Mrs. Asquith.</p>

<p>Lady Beatty made a very intelligent criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the Admiral’s portrait, and as the result of her suggestions
certain alterations were made.</p>

<p>Lady Jellicoe’s criticism was quite favourable.
“You have been extremely fortunate in catching my
husband’s expression,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Asquith did not make any comments, but her
young son, who came with her, derived not a little
amusement from his distinguished father’s presentment,
and showed his appreciation by coming again
and bringing a boy friend to see it the very next day.</p>

<p>Tussaud’s as educator&mdash;Queer questions&mdash;Wanted, a “model” wife&mdash;Quaint
extract from an Indian’s diary.</p>

</div>

<p>An American visitor to the Exhibition once said
to me, “You know, this show is a liberal education,
a history of Europe in kind. I never learned so
much history in any one afternoon. Why don’t you
write your reminiscences?”</p>

<p>I told him that I probably should do so one day,
and he replied characteristically:</p>

<p>“There is no time like the present. Get on with it,
and put me down as a subscriber.”</p>

<p>A French Ambassador is reported to have said: “A
day in Tussaud’s is worth a year at Oxford; it fixes
history as no tutor could.”</p>

<p>On more than one occasion schoolmasters have made
a similar remark with reference to the value of the
figures and exhibits in Madame Tussaud’s as a means
of impressing the minds of their boys with the episodes
of history. Teachers often bring their pupils, and I
am constantly receiving appreciative letters after a
visit.</p>

<p>Schoolboys themselves, I have always noticed, take
the keenest possible interest in all they see, and I frequently
overhear them eagerly challenging one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
concerning the identity and lives of historical personages
as they confront their models.</p>

<p>The Exhibition has been frequently consulted as an
authority upon innumerable historical subjects, especially
with regard to matters dealing with portraiture,
biography, and costume, and many of the questions
submitted might well have puzzled even the compiler
of an encyclopædia. Queries are almost always coupled
with an urgent request for immediate reply.</p>

<p>Peculiarities of well-known people are fruitful topics
for inquiry. The following are a few of the questions
put:</p>

<p>“On which side of Cromwell’s face did his warts
grow?”</p>

<p>“Which was the arm that Nelson lost, and which
was his blind eye?”</p>

<p>“Was Byron’s club-foot the right or the left?”</p>

<p>“Did Mary, Queen of Scots, have brown eyes or
blue?”</p>

<p>Again: “What was the height of Napoleon?”&mdash;the
most frequent question of all.</p>

<p>Other popular problems relate to costume:</p>

<p>“Did the Black Prince really wear black armour?
Or to what was his cognomen due?”</p>

<p>We were consulted during the period when preparations
were in progress for the late King Edward’s coronation
so as to decide what was the correct tone of purple
for the royal robes. As we have in our possession
the robes actually worn by George IV at that King’s
coronation, we allowed a broad hem on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
trains to be unstitched, thus revealing the original colour,
unchanged by exposure to dust and light.</p>

<p>In this connection the following quotation from
Thackeray’s <cite>The Four Georges</cite>, published in 1861, is
interesting:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Madame Tussaud has got King George’s coronation
robes; is there any man now alive who would kiss the
hem of that trumpery? He sleeps since thirty years.</p>

</div>

<p>The same author also mentions the Exhibition in
the following extract from <cite>The Newcomes</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For pictures they do not seem to care much; they
thought the National Gallery a dreary exhibition, and
in the Royal Academy could be got to admire nothing
but the picture of M’Collop of M’Collop, by our friend
of the like name: but they think Madame Tussaud’s
interesting exhibition of Waxwork the most delightful
in London: and there I had the happiness of introducing
them to our friend Mr. Frederick Bayham; who,
subsequently, on coming to this office with his valuable
contributions on the Fine Arts, made particular inquiries
as to their pecuniary means, and expressed himself
instantly ready to bestow his hand upon the mother
or daughter, provided old Mr. Binnie would make a
satisfactory settlement.</p>

<p>Inquiries from members of the public often come
about through a dispute which has ended in a wager,
but many and various are the reasons that are assigned
by the questioner for his query. Sometimes my
correspondent is a writer of books, who wants to give
a correct description of a character or incident.</p>

<p>This leads me to the subject of misconception, and
it is surprising how deep-rooted are the inaccuracies
that have crept into the minds of visitors with regard
to the models they have seen in the Exhibition. Many
of our patrons express themselves as absolutely certain
that figures have done things which I am equally positive
they never did and never could do.</p>

<p class="caption">WILLIAM COBBETT</p>

<p class="captionsub">Noted English political writer.</p>

</div>

<p>What is the use of telling individuals that the originator
of Hansard’s Parliamentary Debates, William
Cobbett, who turns his head from side to side, does not
take snuff, when they insist that they have actually
seen him lift his hand from his snuff-box to his nose?
Yet this is a widespread fallacy.</p>

<p>The figure of Marat dying in his bath never has
breathed; it is the bosom of the Sleeping Beauty that
rises and falls as she reposes in slumber.</p>

<p>Neither does Henry VIII turn his head to inspect his
six wives. Those who think he does must be confusing
him with the aforesaid Cobbett, although not a few
readers of history think that the head of Bluff King
Hal, who caused so many people to be beheaded, must
itself have been “turned.”</p>

<p>Some years ago an elderly bachelor from the Midlands
called to ask whether we could make him a model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of a lady based upon his own description and sketches
and dressed in clothes designed by himself.</p>

<p>I should have attached no importance to the matter
had I not, my curiosity being whetted, asked a few
questions of the caller.</p>

<p>It then transpired that the model was to represent
his ideal woman whom he had been unable to discover
in real life. He was anxious to have a woman about
the house “pleasing to the eye, but at the same time
somewhat less loquacious than the usual run of females,”
as he put it.</p>

<p>He proposed that the model should be placed in an
adjustable chair and be jointed, so that at meal-times
it could sit at the head of his lonely table and at other
times could recline at ease beside the fire, opposite his
own armchair.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the commission was not accepted.</p>

<p>It is very natural that such an institution as
Madame Tussaud’s should include the “curious”
among its diversified store of anecdote.</p>

<p>One quaint document in our archives is the published
diary of an Indian officer, Jemadar, No. 1427,
Abdur Razzak, of the 15th Madras Lancers, from
which I give the following extract relating to a visit
he paid to the Exhibition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On the 5th June, 1893, we went to see the Wax
Work “Madame Tussaud,” where we first saw a
woman in red dress with a basket full of different kinds
of flowers all made in wax with her, which was very
difficult to make out that she was an image, but when
we entered the building we saw lots of images of emperors
and kings, and remarkable persons both men
and women with rich and poor dresses on.</p>

<p>I really say that I was very much admired to see
these images, and was in many places in the buildings
mistook the visitors to be of them when they were
standing still, but when they moved was very much
ashamed on account of my misunderstanding; by this
we made our minds to be little far from both the images
and the visitors and servants in the building.</p>

<p>We saw the throne of Her Majesty just the same
we have seen on the 9th May, 1893, besides this one
more image in shape with Her Majesty in a room writing
something on a table with a candle on it, and this
too quite astonishing.</p>

<p>We also saw a gentleman on elephant’s back in a
jungle has hunted a tiger, the pair of which attacked
the elephant round its trunk taking to him and the
elephant putting its head down and a gentleman on it,
aiming to fire on the tiger.</p>

<p>We saw a room in which were the images of almost
all the assassinators with the particulars of their deeds.
We also saw a place in which all the weapons, etc.,
to take revenge of assassinators, such as scabbard,
hanging, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Stars of the stage in my studio&mdash;Miss Ellen Terry has a cup of
tea&mdash;Sir Squire and Lady Bancroft&mdash;Sir Henry Irving and
the cabby&mdash;We comply with a strange request.</p>

</div>

<p>People sometimes ask me how my portraits are
taken, and how my subjects sit to me.</p>

<p>It is very much with my work as it is with the work
of a sculptor. There is practically only this distinction
in principle&mdash;the sculptor reproduces his work in
marble or bronze, and I execute mine in wax, both
working from a first impression in clay. Added to this
there is, of course, a difference in the matter of treatment.</p>

<p>Sitters have their own peculiar characteristics, and
often require humouring.</p>

<p>I once wrote to Miss Ellen Terry, asking her to do
me the honour of sitting to me; and she replied that
she would be pleased to do so, making no appointment.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the vivacious actress found
her way to my studio door without anyone to guide her,
and how she got there has always puzzled me. I was
engrossed in some urgent work, when a rap came and
Miss Terry sailed in, all smiles and animation.</p>

<p>She did not introduce herself. There was no need.
I knew her instantly, as I supposed she imagined I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
should. It was a very hot day, and she said, “I am
positively dying for a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>She told me she was just clearing off all her visiting
arrears before sailing, and added: “You see, Mr.
Tussaud, I have not forgotten you.”</p>

<p>The cup that cheers was very soon brewed, and Miss
Terry saw that I noticed a gauntlet on her right hand
as she raised the cup to her lips.</p>

<p>“I met with a slight accident on the stage,” she said.</p>

<p>I wish I could recall some of her delightful chat, and
I regret that I did not keep a diary instead of trusting
entirely to memory. However, I may derive some
consolation from the conclusion, arrived at by an old
and experienced literary friend, that it is seldom what
has been forgotten would have been worth writing
about had it been remembered.</p>

<p>When I had finished modelling, and not till then,
Miss Terry apologised for being in a hurry, and as she
took her departure I found myself wondering by what
secret art or gift she could conjure up so much mirth
and sprightliness when the thermometer was registering
ninety in the shade.</p>

<p>After Miss Terry had gone my eye happened to
catch the chair on which she had been sitting, and I
discovered that the back legs were within an eighth of
an inch of the edge of the high dais.</p>

<p>I trembled to think of what might have happened
to the actress if the chair had fallen to the floor while
she occupied it. I suppose the reason for its position
having changed from that in which it was originally
placed was that the actress, who could hardly be described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
as a reposeful “sitter,” had shifted it in her
restlessness.</p>

<p>The carpenter had omitted to fix the fillet which
should have been placed to preclude any risk of the
chair falling from its elevated position.</p>

<p>Only a few months ago Lady Bancroft, speaking
at a matinée in aid of King George’s Pension Fund
for Actors, made an amusing allusion to Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>She had just been listening to the dialogue between
Peg Woffington, played by Irene Vanburgh, and Triplet,
and she said:</p>

<p>“When it was arranged that my husband should
come from his retirement to play the part of Triplet,
we were very much exercised where to find his old
costume.</p>

<p>“Then, all at once, we remembered the last time
we saw that costume was at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Of course you have been melted down by
this time.’</p>

<p>“He said, ‘What do you think they have made of
me? Perhaps Marshal Foch, perhaps President Poincaré,
perhaps President Wilson. I only hope my figure
has not been melted down to something in the
Chamber of Horrors.’”</p>

<p>None laughed more heartily than the King at Lady
Bancroft’s story.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1889, that the Bancrofts gave
me several sittings. The merry laughter of the actress
made the time pass quickly and my work a real
joy.</p>

<p class="caption">SIR SQUIRE BANCROFT</p>

<p class="captionsub">Whose model as Triplet, together with the model of Lady Bancroft
as Peg Woffington, are on exhibition at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

</div>

<p>When the models of Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft were
added to the Exhibition, in the characters of Peg
Woffington and Triplet in <cite>Masks and Faces</cite>, reference
to this was made in our Easter announcement.</p>

<p>Sir Squire Bancroft tells the following story in this
connection:</p>

<p>“A young man from the country visited the Exhibition
on Easter Monday of that year, and went straight
to the Chamber of Horrors. He said he wanted to see
the ‘<em>squire who murdered a triplet</em>’!”</p>

<p>They tell me that Henry Irving came to see his portrait
a year after I had modelled him, but, unfortunately,
I missed the great actor that day.</p>

<p>Mention of Irving takes my mind back rather a long
way, to the time when I had the pleasure of introducing
his model and that of Miss Ellen Terry to the Exhibition.
They were on the eve of making their first
journey across the Atlantic, and they cheerfully consented
to enable me to let the public see them in their
absence.</p>

<p>Irving was an ideal sitter, as might be expected of a
great actor. He adapted himself to my requirements
in every detail, and gave me to feel that he took great
pleasure in my work. I very soon became aware of
Irving’s kindliness of heart and his sympathy with an
artist at his labours.</p>

<p>Conversation turned upon the question of insuring
Madame Tussaud’s against fire, and Irving remarked
that money would be a very poor compensation for the
loss of our irreplaceable collection, especially having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
regard to the relics of Napoleon and the heads of the
French revolutionaries.</p>

<p>The actor told me of an alarming experience he
had while acting at the Lyceum Theatre.</p>

<p>The play was nearing its most dramatic climax when
he noticed that fire had broken out in the “sky borders,”
and the fear of a panic in the audience rose in
his mind lest any member of it should chance to see
the flames.</p>

<p>He admitted that it was an ordeal that required all
his courage to face without betraying signs of anxiety,
but he succeeded in continuing to play his part without
a single person in the front of the house suspecting that
there was any cause for alarm.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the stage carpenters and attendants
were able to extinguish the fast-spreading flames without
any interruption. The curtain was eventually rung
down on an applauding audience, quite oblivious of
the danger that had threatened.</p>

<p>Irving lighted his pipe on his departure, which set
me thinking that he would have enjoyed a smoke during
the sitting, but was too courteous and considerate
to suggest one. He told me he hoped, on his return
from America, to visit the Exhibition and see his portrait.
He came and saw it, but I did not see him.</p>

<p>Sir Henry used to employ the same cabman to take
him to the theatre each evening. He asked him once
if he had ever seen him act, and, the man replying in
the negative, Irving gave him five shillings with which
the cabman could procure seats for himself and his wife
in the pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day the actor asked the driver
what he thought of him on the stage.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said the ingenuous jehu,
“we didn’t go.”</p>

<p>“Not go,” said Irving, “when I gave you the money
for the seats!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the man, “it was this way. It was
my missus’s birthday, and I asked her which she would
prefer to do&mdash;go to see you act, or go to Madame
Tussaud’s, and she said she preferred the waxworks.”</p>

<p>Irving often related this story against himself with
the greatest gusto, enjoying it quite as much as his hearers
did.</p>

<p>On many occasions Madame Tussaud’s has been of
service to the stage.</p>

<p>When the late W. G. Wills, the author of <cite>Jane
Shore</cite>, a prolific playwright in his day, was at the
height of his popularity, my father was approached by
Mr. Coleman, manager of the Queen’s Theatre, Long
Acre, to produce for him a figure of Charles I.</p>

<p>The reason of this request was, surely, one of the
strangest that ever entered the brain of even the most
enterprising of theatrical managers.</p>

<p>Mr. George Rignold was playing at that theatre a
drama, written by Wills, entitled <cite>Cromwell</cite>. This
play was the successor of another by the same dramatist,
namely, <cite>Charles I</cite>, in which Irving played the part of
the King, and confirmed the reputation he had made in
<cite>The Bells</cite>.</p>

<p>A bargain had been struck that if <cite>Charles I</cite> succeeded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Wills should write <cite>Cromwell</cite> for Mr. Coleman.
<cite>Charles I</cite> proved a great success at the Lyceum, but
<cite>Cromwell</cite> was a comparative failure at the Queen’s.</p>

<p>I come now to the reason of Mr. Coleman’s request
for a waxen model of the King.</p>

<p>He said he wanted it to repose in the coffin on the
stage to stimulate the imagination of the actor, Mr.
Rignold, when rendering the long oration delivered by
Cromwell in the presence of the dead monarch.</p>

<p>The model was furnished with every detail, even
to the clothing in which the body was attired. I was
afterwards told that only the manager, the actor, and
my father were aware of the realistic plan that had
been devised to accentuate an actor’s eloquence.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Literary sitters&mdash;George R. Sims’s impromptu&mdash;His ordeal in the
Chamber of Horrors&mdash;George Augustus Sala’s masterpiece.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. G. R. Sims was a cheery, entertaining sitter;
not, perhaps, what most artists would consider
a helpful one. His active mind busied itself with every
object of interest around him. He would know all
about them, and tell each off with some droll quip or
whimsical jest.</p>

<p>I have spent many a bright hour with “Dagonet”&mdash;yes,
even including those spent with him in the Chamber
of Horrors.</p>

<p>I once chanced to have a book of his (the <cite>Dagonet
Ballads</cite>) in my hand when he came into my studio,
and I asked him to sign his name in it. Without a
moment’s hesitation he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Tussaud</span>,</p>

<p>I’m a model man.</p>

<p>You’re a modeller.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">G. R. Sims</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after we had decided to add Mr. Sims’s figure
to the Exhibition, Mrs. G. A. Sala happened to meet
him, and questioned him as to the sensations he experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in picturing himself as a waxen celebrity.</p>

<p>“I feel very frightened indeed,” he promptly replied,
“and more than that, exceedingly sorry that I
ever promised to become a waxwork, for I have been
told since that if the public grow weary of your presence,
or the Tussauds get offended with you, they melt
you down, and build up a more popular fellow out of
your dripping. Nasty idea, very!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sala said it certainly <em>was</em> a very nasty idea;
but if there were any truth in the melting-down story,
G. R. could enjoy the satisfaction of thinking that he
might have arisen in his waxen grandeur from the
“dripping” of someone less popular than himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Sims said that so long as the public only stuck
pins into him, or stamped on his toes, he did not mind;
but he should feel it very much if they were to bang
him about the head with an umbrella, or take him by
the collar and shake him.</p>

<p>It must have been in the early winter of the year
1891, while I was modelling him, that Mr. Sims had
the following interesting and somewhat unpleasant
experience, which he himself describes. He says:</p>

<p>“I have been penetrating the secrets of Tussaud’s
lately, and had a specially quiet half-hour alone with
the murderers in the Chamber of Horrors, just to see
what it was like.</p>

<p>“The idea came to me one night when I had been
sitting late to Mr. John Tussaud. I wanted to see
what it would feel like to be all alone with those awful
people with only one dim jet of gas lighting up their
fearful features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“After the door was shut I walked about and
whistled, and stared defiantly at William Corder and
James Bloomfield Rush, and even went so far as to
address M. Eyraud in French. But wandering about
in the semi-darkness I stumbled and fell, and when I
got up and looked around me I found I was in Mrs.
Pearcey’s kitchen.</p>

<p>“Then I made one wild rush at the closed door, and
hammered at it until the kindly watchman came and
let me out. I never want to be shut up alone at night
in the Chamber of Horrors again as long as I live.”</p>

<p>Humorously describing my studios at the time, Mr.
Sims says:</p>

<p>“At Madame Tussaud’s I am at present in rather a
curious condition. There is a good deal of the Thames
mystery about me. It is not given to every man to
see his legs in one room, his hands hanging up in another,
and his head on a shelf, looking about anxiously
for his body.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I quite like looking at my head on a
shelf. It suggests decapitation and Madame de Lamballe’s
head on a pike as Louis caught sight of it when
the mob held it up at the window.</p>

<p>“But I am assured that I shall be put together next
week, and that my limbs will once more be found together
as Nature intended they should be.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that Scotch sixpenny which refers
to me in highly uncomplimentary terms about
seven times in every column will say, but the exigencies
of space at the Marylebone Museum have compelled
the management to put me next to Lord Tennyson. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
am sure that this will be such a shock to my modesty
that I shall go hot and melt the very first day that
the weather is at all warm.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, I shall have a brother journalist to
support me and keep me in countenance, for while Lord
Tennyson is seated writing poetry in his study, Mr.
George Augustus Sala in <em>his</em> study sits next door to
him, dashing off one of his brilliant leaders for the
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>. It is in a study built up on the other
side of Lord Tennyson that the visitor to Madame Tussaud’s
will at an early date find himself face to face
with ‘Dagonet.’”</p>

<p>There George R. Sims has been seated ever since.
Twenty-eight years ago! Time has wrought many
changes, but during the whole of that period I have
uninterruptedly enjoyed Mr. Sims’s valued friendship.</p>

<p class="captionsub">The bust of the eminent journalist, first exhibited at the
Royal Academy, London, in 1890, by John T. Tussaud.</p>

</div>

<p>George Augustus Sala sat to me about the same
time, and a very good sitter he was. The celebrated
journalist lived in a flat at Victoria Street, Westminster,
where I called on him, and I remember his
saying to me with pride:</p>

<p>“I’m taking up modern Greek in my sixtieth year.
What do you think I am reading? I am reading an
excellent account in Greek of the Stanfield Hall murder.”</p>

<p>During the autumn of 1889 I had seen a good deal of
Mr. Sala, for we were at that time discussing the details
for the rewriting of our Exhibition Catalogue.</p>

<p>He had always taken a great interest in Madame
Tussaud’s, and, like many other literary men, had
found it useful as a place of reference on matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
portraiture and costume. He entered upon the scheme
for producing a better and larger Catalogue with great
enthusiasm, but I soon discovered that the work was
hardly likely to receive that equable treatment necessary
for a book of the kind.</p>

<p>There were certain subjects his mind positively ran
riot on, while others scarcely aroused the slightest interest.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette and Mary, Queen of Scots, stirred
his imagination most of all, and to the ill-fated Queen
of Louis XVI he reverted so often that it seemed the
book was likely to be over-weighted with matter dealing
with her sad career, to the exclusion of so much else
of vital importance to our handbook.</p>

<p>Whenever he stood in front of the decapitated head
of Marie Antoinette he always contemplated it in
silence&mdash;and invariably passed from it without making
any remark, as if it were a subject too sad for ordinary
comment.</p>

<p>“I have done the Marie Antoinette biography,”
greeted me long before the work had been definitely
agreed upon, and six or seven pages of essay were
pressed into my hands as an accomplished undertaking
that positively left no room for further consideration.

<p>There are some stories so dreadful in the immensity
of human misery which they reveal&mdash;there
are some tragedies of which the catastrophe is
one of such unmitigated horror, that the reader who
has general impressions of what will be the end of the
dismal tale, but who is unfamiliar with its particular
circumstances, is unable to follow, without some kind
of impatience, the opening scenes of the drama. He
has continually in his mind’s eye the awful falling of
the curtain on anguish and despair and death. Half
unconsciously he hastens on in his perusal, and slurs
over minor episodes and seemingly trifling facts, forgetting
that these are subsidiary and auxiliary to the
terrible consummation which he so anxiously awaits.
“Toutes choses meuvent vers leur fin,” Rabelais has
said; but the little things&mdash;the slender fibres of a
story&mdash;are gathered up as it proceeds, into bundles;
and, acquiring importance from consolidation, are ultimately
merged in the final and tremendous whole.</p>

<p>Thus there have been many records of human life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and action, now real, now artificial, in reading which
we have to encounter an almost uncontrollable impulse
to turn to the end, and ascertain whether that of which
we have had, at the beginning, a vague forecast, will
really come to pass. Who, if he will only have the
candour to acknowledge it, has not had to struggle
with such an impulse in reading, say, the <cite>Electra</cite> of
Sophocles, the <cite>Faust</cite> of Goethe, and the <cite>Bride of
Lammermoor</cite> of Scott?&mdash;three of the most perfectly
tragic dramas, I take it, ever fashioned by the hand of
mortal genius. And so it is with numerous tragedies
of superhuman structure and ordinance. In both cases
we pant for the last scene of all, which is to end the
strange eventful history. What will be the fate of
Aegisthus, and the doom of Clytemnestra? Who, if
anyone, will rescue Gretchen from a shameful death?
How will Edgar Ravenswood bear his immeasurable
sorrow?</p>

<p>These are the problems which agitate us in the study
of fiction, and irresistibly impel us to hasten from the
prologue to the epilogue&mdash;from the exordium to the
peroration. And to speed as quickly is usually our desire
when we are confronted with the tragedies of history,
or with the vouched-for chronicles of human
passion and crime. Throw down on the floor Clarendon’s
<cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, it has been said, and
the volume will open, automatically, at the page where
the execution of Charles I is described. Try to concentrate
your thoughts on the history of Marie Stuart;
and, coldly, clearly, sternly distinct in the midst of a
whirligig of scenes and events&mdash;the Louvre, Holyrood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the Kirk of Field, Lochleven and what not&mdash;there
stands out the image of the Hall at Fotheringay, the
black scaffold, the block, the masked headsman; the
Dean of Peterborough drearily homilising, and the
Puritan Earl of Kent ranting; while the weeping tire-women
disrobe the royal victim, her little pet dog
snuggling by her, not without difficulty when the axe
has fallen to be dislodged from the corse of the kind
mistress he loved so well, and who has been stricken
down by cruel men, he knows not why. See this, as
I see it.</p>

<p>It is my purpose to write something on the eventful
life and dreadful ending of Queen Marie Antoinette.
I try, when I remember the sunshine of her early days&mdash;her
youth, her beauty, her grace&mdash;to put myself in
a cheerful frame of mind. I wish to look, at least for
a little while, on the bright side of a career which
began so splendidly and so happily. I would fain picture
to myself the daughter of Maria Theresa, as Edmund
Burke saw her at Versailles&mdash;smiling, radiant,
adored. I would fain hear the clash of the thirty thousand
swords which should have leaped from their
scabbards to avenge the slightest affront to the peerless
consort of the King of France and Navarre.</p>

<p>I take from my shelves the <cite>Journal de Madame
Eloff</cite>&mdash;the ledger containing the milliner and dressmaker’s
bills of a perhaps too extravagant young Queen&mdash;an
endless catalogue of taffetas and satins, gauze and
ribbons, high-heeled shoes and embroidered gloves,
scent-bottles, reticules, feathers, artificial flowers and
fans. From an old Boule cabinet I lift tenderly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
dainty little coffee-cup of Sèvres egg-shell porcelain,
adorned with an exquisite miniature of her, painted
when she had only been two years the wife of the
hapless Louis. The cup is half embedded in a setting
of velvet <i lang="fr">bleu du Roi</i>; and, alas! when I draw the
ceramic gem delicately from the case I see that the cup
has no handle.</p>

<p>A maimed relic, this porcelain trifle, possibly of a
priceless breakfast set, wantonly shattered by a howling
mob of <i lang="fr">poissardes</i> and red night-capped “patriots” who
had sacked one of the Royal Palaces. A crowd of
memories are conjured up by this morsel of dismembered
Sèvres. I see, as in a glass darkly, the Galerie
des Glaces and the Œil-de-Boeuf at Versailles. I see
the toy Dairy at the Petit Trianon; the banquet of the
Gardes du Corps in the Great Theatre of the Palace;
the King and Queen: the Royal Princesses circulating
among the guests and distributing white cockades
among them; while the musicians make the hall resound
with the strains of “<cite>Oh, Richard! Oh, mon Roi!</cite>”</p>

<p>No, surely, the age of Chivalry is not past, and thrice
ten thousand glaives will leap into the light to vindicate
the outraged Majesty of France. There’s no such
thing! A confused picture&mdash;a panorama all torn to
shreds and splashed with mud and flecked with blood
flows before me. The Etats Genéraux have wed: the
nobility sparkling in velvet and plumes and golden
broideries; the clergy brave in copes and mitres and
point lace: the “Tiers Etat,” all in sombre black, short-cloaked,
slouch-hatted, grave, preoccupied, looking unutterable
things. Among them looms, very real and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
portentous indeed, a thick-set, pock-marked man, with
an eye of fire. This is Honore Gabriel Riquetti, rightly
Comte de Mirabeau, but who has broken with his order,
and styling himself “Mirabeau Marchand de
Draps”&mdash;a retail clothier from Marseilles, forsooth! of
about forty-eight hours’ commercial standing&mdash;stalks
among country notaries and shopkeepers, farmers and
shopkeepers as a Deputy of the Third Estate.</p>

<p>But all these fade away from my field of vision. I
set to studying and balancing my rambling thoughts.
I have to deal with Marie Antoinette, Josephe-Jeanne
de Lorraine, wife of Louis XVI, and who was born,
you will remember, at Vienna, on the 2nd of November,
1755, the very day of that earthquake at Lisbon
in the occurrence of which Dr. Johnson for a long
time so resolutely refused to believe. Would the doctor,
I wonder, had he lived in 1793, have declined to
place credence in a newspaper report of what is now to
be narrated&mdash;an upheaval more dreadful and disastrous
than any physical convulsion of the earth’s crust? The
tattered, muddy, gory panorama fades into a murky
nothingness. Then, out of the Valley of Shadows
there arises, terribly distinct and substantial, THIS&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a raw, chilly, marrow-searching day in the
month of October, 1793. A spacious hall, known in
this new and blessed era of Universal Regeneration,
and Unlimited Throat-Cutting, as the Salle de la
Liberté, in the Palais de Justice, hard by the prison of
the Conciergerie, has been swept and garnished for the
trial of the discrowned and desolate widow of “Louis
Capet,” murdered on the scaffold in the Place de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Révolution last January. In a dark and filthy dungeon
of that same Conciergerie Marie Antoinette has been
immured since August. The walls of the Salle de la
Liberté have been newly whitewashed&mdash;no voluptuous
frescoes or oil painting in this abode of Republican simplicity,
if you please: only patriotic lime-whiting and
democratic glue&mdash;and the almost blinding glare of the
stark walls brings out in strong relief the dark green
canopy suspended over the heads of the Judges of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, who are five in number, the
President being one, Hermann.</p>

<p>Above this precious conclave are the busts of Brutus&mdash;save
the mark!&mdash;and two recent Revolutionary notorieties:
the infamous Marat, deservedly done to
death by Charlotte Corday and the member of the Convention,
Lepelletier de St. Fargeau, who had voted for
the death sentence on Louis XVI, and who immediately
afterwards was stabbed to death by an ex-Garde du
Corps in an eating house in the Palais National&mdash;once
Palais Royal. The busts are crowned with scarlet
caps of liberty, adorned with monstrous tri-coloured
cockades, and are flanked by two huge oil lamps. There
will be need of the lamps; for the deliberation of the
tribunal will probably last far into the night.</p>

<p>The judges sit at a long table which, although
shabby, is somewhat pretentious in its upholstering,
since the legs are of mahogany, and fluted, and the
brazen feet are fashioned in the shape of griffin’s
claws, and exhibit some traces of bygone gilding. This
table is yet extant, and forms part of the furniture
of the Court of Cassation, which at present holds its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
sittings in the old Salle de la Liberté. The Public
Accuser has his place in front of the President; the
jury&mdash;yes, this monstrous tribunal has a jury!&mdash;is to
the left of the judges; and to the right is the desk of
the Counsel for the defence. Behind him is the seat
for the prisoners. A breast-high balustrade separates
the Court from the space set apart for the public,
which is ample enough, and is thronged, this dreary
October morning, by a motley crew of <i lang="fr">sans culottes</i>,
mechanics, lamplighters, bargemen and coarse, loud-voiced
women from the markets, some of them known
as “<i lang="fr">Tricoteuses</i>” and “Furies of the Guillotine.”</p>

<p>Between the balustrade and the body of the Court
runs a long gangway, at one extremity of which is a
door, communicating by means of a narrow staircase
with the Gaol of the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>Up this staircase and through this door, and along
this gangway, and so through an opening of the balustrade
into the criminal dock, there is brought, between
two gendarmes, a woman of middle age, with abundant
hair which has turned quite grey lately, and features
which retain a few&mdash;a very few&mdash;traces of former
comeliness. She is barely eight-and-thirty, and she
looks full fifty. She is miserably clad in an old,
patched, threadbare gown of black serge, which has
been mended for her innumerable times by a compassionate
girl named Rosalie, the daughter of the gaoler.
Her shoes are old, full of holes, and down at heel.
She wears black cotton stockings, and about her shoulders
is arranged a kind of tippet, or pelérine, of frayed
white muslin. As yet she wears no cap; and her long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
tresses have been carefully dressed and oiled this morning
by the pitying Rosalie. Obviously, she is in mourning
for her husband, sometime King of France and
Navarre; but the Revolutionary Tribunal knows nothing
of such titles, and in the Act of Accusation, which
is read in a monotonous sing-song by the <i lang="fr">Greffier</i>, the
prisoner is arraigned as “Marie Antoinette, of Austria
and Lorraine, widow of Louis Capet.”</p>

<p>The indictment goes on to say that the widow Capet
has by her crimes rendered herself the worthy compeer
of Brunéhaut, Fredegonde, and Catherine de Medicis;
that since she has had her abode in France she has
been the scourge and bloodsucker of her adopted country;
and that even before “the Happy Revolution which
gave the French their sovereignty” she entered into
political correspondence with “the man calling himself
King of Bohemia and Hungary”&mdash;this is the Emperor
of Austria her brother&mdash;that, in conjunction with
the brothers of Louis Capet, and “the execrable and infamous
Calonne” she had squandered the resources of
France (the fruit of the sweat of the people) in a
dreadful manner, “to satisfy inordinate pleasures and
to pay the agents of her criminal intrigues.”</p>

<p>In another count of the indictment she is charged
with being “an adept in all sorts of crimes.” One of
these “crimes” is, that on the evening of the famous
banquet to the Garde du Corps, and the Regiment de
Flanders, in the Opera House at Versailles, she, with
the King and a numerous and brilliant following, had
passed between the lines of tables, distributing white
cockades to the officers and encouraging them to trample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the national or tri-coloured cockade under foot.</p>

<p>“Prisoner,” thunders the President, “were you there
when the band played the air, ‘<i lang="fr">Oh, Richard, oh mon
Roi</i>’?”</p>

<p>“I do not recollect,” replies the Queen.</p>

<p>“Were you there when the toast of ‘The Nation’
was proposed and refused?”</p>

<p>“I do not think that I was.”</p>

<p>“Did not your husband read his speech to the representatives
to you half-an-hour before he delivered it?”</p>

<p>“My husband had great confidence in me, and that
made him read his speech to me; but I made no observations.”</p>

<p>Fancy cutting a poor woman’s head off because her
husband read her a speech which he was about to deliver
in public! Does Mr. Gladstone, does Lord Randolph
Churchill, does Sir William Harcourt, I wonder,
ever favour the domestic circle with such “fore-lectures”
as Dr. Furnival might call them?</p>

<p>A remarkable witness against Marie Antoinette is a
ruffian named Roussillon, who deposes that on the
fatal Tenth of August when the Tuileries was stormed
by the mob, he saw under the Queen’s bed a number of
empty wine-bottles, “from which,” adds Roussillon,
“I concluded that she had herself distributed wine to
the Swiss soldiers, that these wretches in their intoxication
might assassinate the people.”</p>

<p>Another witness testifies that among the effects of
the ex-Queen found at the prison of the Temple was
a satin riband bearing the gilt image of a Heart with
the inscription “<i lang="la">Cor Jesu miserere nobis</i>.” Other testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is to the effect that while the Queen and the
children were incarcerated in the Temple, after the
execution of Louis, the poor little Dauphin was placed
at the top of the table by his mother, and was served
first; thus justifying the inference that she ignored the
Republic, One and Indivisible, and recognised her
young son as Louis XVII, and the successor of his murdered
sire.</p>

<p>Another charge, an abominable charge, and one so
monstrous as to make it scarcely credible that it should
be launched against a woman and a mother, is that
she had systematically sought to corrupt the mind of
the poor young prince. To this horrible allegation she
makes at first no answer. At length, when the charge is
repeated, she is moved to noble indignation, and exclaims:
You accuse me of an impossibility: “<i lang="fr">J’en
appelle à toutes les mères</i>.” I appeal to all mothers.
But the instinct of maternity seems to be dead in all
that hall of blood, and the beldames in the public tribunes
only yell and gibe at her.</p>

<p>Less revolting, but equally preposterous, is the evidence
of one Renée Mullet, a chambermaid who has
been in service at Versailles, and this hussey swears
that one day, “in a moment of good humour,” she
asked the <i lang="fr">ci-devant</i> Duc de Coigny whether the Emperor
still continued to wage war against the Turks;
as in that case France would soon be ruined, the Queen
having sent her brother no less than two hundred millions
of livres, wherewith to carry on hostilities. To
this, according to the gossiping waiting woman, the
Duke made answer: “Thou art right enough. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
hundred millions have already been spent, and we are
not at the end of it yet.”</p>

<p>It is on such evidence as this&mdash;evidence not heavy
enough to detach a feather from a pigeon’s wing, not
convincing enough to prove a forty shilling debt, the
wretched Marie Antoinette is at length convicted. The
President sums up, furiously, against her. The advocates
who defend her, Chauveau and Tronçon-Ducoudray
have little to say, to the point, and can only
feebly plead for clemency to be extended to her; and
the jury, after deliberating for fifty-five minutes, return
a verdict <em>affirming all the charges submitted to them</em>.
Hermann calls on the accused to declare whether she
has any objection to make to the sentence of the law demanded
by the Public Accuser. Marie Antoinette bows
her head in token of a negative.</p>

<p>Then the tribunal, putting their bloodthirsty heads
together for a few minutes, condemn Marie Antoinette
of Austria and Lorraine, widow of Louis Capet to the
punishment of Death, “and the confiscation of all her
property for the benefit of the Republic, the sentence
to be executed in the Square of the Revolution.” The
confiscation of all her property! When she was dead,
an inventory was taken of the few rags which she had
left behind her in her cell in the Conciergerie, and they
were appraised at the magnificent sum of nine livres,
about seven and sixpence sterling. Nine livres all
told! In the second year of her marriage it was computed
that the roll and butter served every morning
to each of her ladies of honour, cost two thousand
livres, or eighty pounds a year; and five thousand livres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
was the annual charge for the bouillon, or beef-tea,
kept hot by day and by night for Madame Royale,
who was a weakly child. During the earlier portion
of her imprisonment the unhappy Queen had been supplied
with body linen by the compassionate care of the
Marchioness of Stafford, the wife of the British Ambassador
in Paris, but there was no kindly Ambassadress
to succour her in her last and darkest days, and
the only hand held forth in pity to this forlorn daughter
of the Cæsars was that of a gaoler’s daughter.</p>

<p>It was half past four on the morning of the sixteenth
of October when this infernal tribunal adjourned,
and the Queen was conducted back to her
prison. Throughout the whole of her trial she had not
ceased to maintain a calm countenance; but at times
she seemed to be giving way to a feeling of sheer weary
listlessness, and moved her fingers on the bar of the
dock before her, as though she was playing on the
harpsichord When she heard the sentence pronounced,
her features did not shew the slightest alteration; and
she walked from the hall erect and seemingly unmoved,
gendarmes with drawn swords before and behind
her, and the beldames of the fish-market and the
rag-shops cursing and shrieking at her, just as you may
see them in Paul Delaroche’s noble picture.</p>

<p>So they took her back to a dungeon twelve feet long,
eight feet broad, four feet underground, with a grated
window on a level with the pavement. Into this
wretched hole some scraps of the coarsest food were
brought her; but she was left under the incessant supervision
of a female prisoner and two soldiers. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
said that she snatched a little sleep. On waking she
asked one of the gendarmes who had been present at
the trial whether she had replied “with too much dignity”
to the question put to her. “I ask,” she added,
“because I overheard a woman say, <cite>See how haughty
she still is</cite>.” The woman who could have made such
an observation must have been one of the hags that
Delaroche has painted.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock in the morning, the entire garrison
of Paris was under arms. Cannon were placed in all
the public places; and at the foot of every bridge from
the Quay of the Conciergerie to the Place de la Révolution,
that magnificent area between the gardens of
the Tuileries, originally called the Place Louis XV,
and now know as the Place de la Concorde. At half-past
eleven Marie Antoinette, dressed in a white linen
déshabille, was brought out from the prison. As though
she had been the commonest of malefactors she was
made to mount the charette, or open cart, the appointed
tumbril of infamy. At least the murderers of
her husband had had the decency to allow him the
“luxury” of a hackney coach, when he was taken from
the Temple to the scaffold. Her hair had been cut
short ere she left the gaol, and what remained of her
formerly luxuriant tresses was tucked under a white
mob-cap. Her hands were tied behind her back.</p>

<p>Of the Queen in this deplorable plight there exists
a very beautiful statue executed by Lord Ronald
Gower. On the right, in the tumbril, was seated Sanson,
the executioner, and on the left a “constitutional”
priest, that is to say, one who had taken the oath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
fealty to the Republic. To the ministrations of this
“patriotic” cleric, who was dressed in light grey coat
and a bob-wig, Marie Antoinette had in the first instance
declined to listen; but she occasionally spoke
to him on her way to the fatal Place de la Révolution.</p>

<p>An immense mob, in which women were revoltingly
numerous, crowded the streets throughout the entire
line of route insulting the Queen and vociferating
“Long live the Republic!” She seldom cast her eyes
on the populace, but from time to time looked with
some curiosity on the prodigious military force surrounding
the cart. Otherwise her attitude throughout
this last dismal pilgrimage was one of half torpid
indifference.</p>

<p>As the cart traversed the Rue St. Honoré, the
numbed faculties of the Queen seemed momentarily to
revive; and she examined with some attention the multitudinous
inscriptions of “Liberty” and “Equality”
over the shop-fronts.</p>

<p>It was as the vehicle turned the corner of the Rue St.
Honoré into that which is now the Rue Royale that
the famous painter, David, who, during the Reign of
Terror, was a furious Jacobin and a friend of Robespierre,
but who was destined to become a Baron of the
Empire, and to paint the Coronation of Napoleon at
Notre Dame, was able from the balcony which he occupied
in company with the wife of a member of the
Convention to make a sketch of Marie Antoinette.
The drawing has come down to us. The features of
the Martyr Queen are sharp and pinched, exhibiting
no traces whatever of former comeliness, and she looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fifty years of age. It may here be mentioned that the
illustrious and pure-minded English sculptor, John
Flaxman, when he visited Paris, after the Peace of
Amiens, resolutely refused to meet the artist who made
the last sketch of Marie Antoinette, and always spoke
of him disdainfully as “David of the bloodstained
brush.”</p>

<p>The historians are divided in opinion as to the demeanor
of Marie Antoinette on the scaffold. Some
say that she laid herself down on the fatal plank with
calm deliberation, and met her death with noble fortitude,
recalling Andrew Marvell’s superb lines on the
execution of Charles I:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And while the armèd bands</div>
<div class="verse">Did clap their bloody hands,</div>
<div class="verse">He nothing common did, nor mean,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon that memorable scene;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor called the gods, in vulgar spite,</div>
<div class="verse">To vindicate his helpless might;</div>
<div class="verse">But, with his keener eye</div>

<div class="verse">Then bowed his comely head</div>
<div class="verse">Down, as upon a bed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Others narrate that the Queen ascended the steps
of the scaffold in great haste, and with apparent impatience,
and turned her eyes with much emotion towards
the Palace of the Tuileries, the scene of her
former greatness, and that she made some slight resistance
before submitting to the executioner. My own
impression is that she was two-thirds dead&mdash;that the
<i lang="la">rigor mortis</i> was upon her before she reached the scaffold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that she was lifted out of the cart and half carried
to the guillotine, and that she did not give the
headsman and his assistants the slightest trouble.</p>

<p>It is, at all events, certain that at half past twelve
her head was severed from her body. One of the
<i lang="fr">valets du bourreau</i>, or executioner’s men, lifted and
showed the head streaming with blood, from the four
quarters of the scaffold, the mob meanwhile screeching
“<i lang="fr">Vive la République!</i>” and it is asserted that a young
man who dipped his handkerchief in the blood, and
pressed it with veneration to his heart, was instantly
apprehended. The corpse of Marie Antoinette was
immediately flung into a pit filled with quicklime, in
the graveyard of the Madeleine where the remains of
her husband had also been interred.</p>

<p>At the Restoration in 1814, diligent search was made
for the ashes of the King and Queen in the cemetery,
on the site of which was subsequently erected an Expiatory
Chapel. Some half calcined bones and a few
scraps of cloth and linen were found; and these last
having been identified by experts as having been part
of the apparel of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette,
the relics with a considerable quantity of the surrounding
earth, were inhumed with much pomp and solemnity,
in the Royal Vault of the Cathedral of St. Denis.</p>

<p>Touching the executioner, it may be expedient to
record that Marie Antoinette was guillotined, not by
Charles Henri Sanson, who beheaded Louis XVI, but
by his son, Henri, who died in Paris in 1840, aged
seventy-three. The elder Sanson died only a few weeks
after he had executed Louis, and the Royalist historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
maintain that his death was hastened by remorse for the
deed which he had been constrained to commit, and
that in his will he bequeathed a considerable sum for
the celebration of an annual Expiatory Mass. But
this is very doubtful. It has been shown, however,
without the possibility of doubt, that the Sanson family
were of Florentine origin, and that the ancestors of
Charles Henri and of Henri Sanson came to France in
the train of Catherine de Medicis. For two hundred
years, without intermission, had members of this
gloomy historic family been executioners in ordinary
to the city of Paris.</p>

<p>In addition to Marie Antoinette, the younger Sanson
decapitated the Queen’s sister-in-law, Madame
Elisabeth, and the eloquent advocate, Malesherbes, who
undertook the defence of Louise XVI. He likewise
beheaded the Duke of Orléans (Philippe Égalité), and
last, but not least, Maximilien Robespierre. The so-called
<cite>Memoirs of the Sanson Family</cite> are more than
half suspected to be mainly apocryphal, and to have
been written by one D’Olbreuse, a bookseller’s hack;
and, according to a writer in the Paris <cite>Temps</cite>, in 1875
the last of the Sansons was a remarkably mild, flaccid
and stupid old gentleman, who was certainly incapable
of writing any “Memoirs” whatever, since his own
memory was hopelessly decayed, and whose circumstances
in his old age became so embarrassed that he
was arrested for debt, and confined in the prison of
Clichy, whence he only procured his enlargement by
<em>pawning the guillotine itself</em> for 4,000 francs!</p>

<p>Shortly after the conclusion of this singular transaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
a murderer had to be executed, and the usual
instructions were issued by the Procureur General to
Henri Sanson, to have his death dealing apparatus
ready on a certain morning in the Place de la Roquette.
It then became necessary to explain to the authorities
that the fatal machine was practically in the custody of
My Uncle. Justice, however, had to be satisfied, and
the murderer’s head was duly cut off on the appointed
morning; but simultaneously with the signature of the
Minister of Justice of a draft for 4,000 francs to release
the hypothecated guillotine, there was issued an
order dismissing Sanson from his post.</p>

<p>And Marie Antoinette? I have drawn her picture
as faithfully as I could, not without much toil and
more perplexity for the memoirs of the period in which
she lived and died absolutely bristle with falsehoods,
the inventions now of Royalist and now of Republican
writers. Comparatively few are the facts concerning
her which have been exactly ascertained and are altogether
indisputable; whereas the name of the unfounded
assertions, the insinuations, the hypotheses, and the
downright lies, is legion. By some this most unhappy
woman has been represented as an angel of goodness
and purity, a faithful spouse, a fond parent, a kind
mistress, and a most pious and charitable princess. By
others she has been depicted as a crafty, unscrupulous
and vindictive woman, as perfidious as Borgia and profligate
as Messalina.</p>

<p>This is no place in which to discuss at length a most
intricate question, all hedged about by obscurity, uncertainties
and mysteries which will, perhaps, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
be solved. At all events, the story which I have told
of her trial and her last moments is true. For the
rest, both Royalists and Republicans agree that Marie
Antoinette was born at Vienna, in 1755, and was the
daughter of Francis of Lorraine, Emperor of Germany,
and of Marie Theresa of Austria. In May, 1770, she
married the Dauphin Louis, who was grandson of
Louis XV of France, and who, in 1774, ascended the
French throne as Louis XVI. It would not seem that
Marie Antoinette was absolutely beautiful, as beautiful,
say, as Queen Louisa of Prussia, or as the Empress
Eugene, still there is a tolerably unanimous consensus
of opinion that she was handsome, lively, amiable,
and thoroughly kind-hearted. It is possible that
she may have been a little thoughtless in her youth;
and the ledgers of Madame Eloffe certainly show that,
as regards her toilet, Marie Antoinette was a most
prodigal Queen. But is it a mortal sin in a young,
pretty and sprightly woman to spend a good deal of
money on dress? How many hundred dresses did our
chaste Queen Elizabeth leave behind her, in her wardrobe,
at her death?</p>

<p>It must be granted that when the dissensions of the
Revolution began, Marie Antoinette was on the Conservative
side, and that she tried her hardest to incline
her husband to that side. Was it so very unnatural
that she should do so? Her brother, the Emperor
Joseph, used to say that “Royalty was his trade”; and
poor Marie Antoinette may have laboured under a
similar persuasion. But the times were very bad indeed
for the “trade” of Royalty, and there arose a grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
conviction among the working millions that the best
way of mending matters was to dethrone, plunder, and
murder their masters and mistresses.</p>

<p>The influence of Marie Antoinette in the councils of
Louis has been, I should say, considerably exaggerated
by her enemies. Her husband, naturally disposed to
concession, was by temper irresolute, and he allowed
himself to be led away by the course of events, instead
of striving to control and direct them. There can be
little doubt, either, that Marie Antoinette was one of
the chief advisers of the flight of the King and Royal
Family to Varennes; and that imprudent enterprise
served, even more fiercely, to inflame the public animosity
against herself and her husband.</p>

<p>But again, I fail to see the criminality of this attempted
escape. The King and Queen knew well
enough that the Revolutionists intended to deprive
them of their crowns, and, in all probability, of their
lives, they had no adequate armed force with which
to resist the mob. Were they not justified in running
away? After the deposition of Louis, all the elements
of grandeur in the character of Marie Antoinette began
to manifest themselves. She showed the greatest
courage during the dastardly attacks made on the Royal
Family; and she appeared to be always more anxious
for the safety of her husband and children than for
her own. She shared their captivity with noble resignation,
and her demeanour under the most trying circumstances
never lost an iota of its dignity. In the
presence of her judges her fortitude never forsook her;
her burst of indignant maternal feeling overawed even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the butchers who were perverting and burlesquing the
law to bring her to the shambles; and her behaviour
in almost unparalleled misfortunes, has won for her
not only the pity and the sympathy, but the reverent
admiration of posterity.</p>

<p>More sitters&mdash;Mr. John Burns walks and talks&mdash;We buy his only
suit&mdash;Mr. George Bernard Shaw has to work for his living&mdash;General
Booth&mdash;Four leading suffragettes&mdash;Christabel’s model
“speaks”&mdash;The Channel swimmer.</p>

</div>

<p>The most restless of all my sitters was the Right
Honourable John Burns, when he was plain
John Burns.</p>

<p>I modelled him in the year 1889 or 1890, at the
time of the great Dock Strike. Mr. Burns was then
throwing all his magnetic personality into the cause
of the workers, and he brought some of that magnetic
personality into my studio. Only in a technical sense
did he “sit” to me. He was walking and talking all
the time.</p>

<p>These were very turbulent days, and Mr. Burns had
figured in the Trafalgar Square riots. Shipowners and
shipbuilders&mdash;and everybody, I imagine, having more
than £500 a year&mdash;were the objects of his implacable
distrust. He was a younger and poorer man then.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns wore the blue reefer suit which had survived
the jostlings of many a crowd, but he did not
bring to my studio the famous straw hat of which so
much was written in the Press at that time. When I
spoke to him about the hat he rather fenced the question,
and to this day I believe that hat to be somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in Mr. Burns’s possession as a treasured souvenir of
his stressful past. I have never seen Mr. Burns wearing
any other kind of clothes than blue serge.</p>

<p>I struck a bargain with the dockers’ champion that he
should let me have the suit he was wearing with which
to clothe his portrait in the Exhibition, and so complete
the realism of the model. Mr. Burns demurred
at first, and then it appeared he had an extremely good
reason for doing so. It was the only suit he possessed,
and we agreed that I should have it as soon as I provided
him with a new one to take its place on his own
back.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns told the story of this transaction in reply
to an interrupter at a public meeting.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that suit?” asked the interrogator.</p>

<p>“I got it,” said Mr. Burns frankly, “from Madame
Tussaud’s. When my portrait was put in the Exhibition
you may, or you may not, have noticed that it
was wearing my old suit. As I had no other clothes
the management gave me the suit I am wearing now,
and I hope you will agree that I made a pretty good
bargain.”</p>

<p>The audience cheered the speaker and booed the
heckler.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns’s portrait has been brought up to date
since then, but it still wears the old reefer suit, and
the fact of this being out of the fashion and rather
skimpy only adds to the effectiveness of the picture by
recalling the working man the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
raised to Cabinet rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>They tell me Mr. Burns is getting white, but when
I modelled him his hair was black and plentiful.</p>

<p><cite>Judy</cite> commemorated the suit incident in the following
verse, depicting Burns making figure eights on
the ice:</p>

<div class="verse">With his Hacmes ’n’ his knobstick too,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A reg’lar ’ristocrat!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A contrast to Mr. Burns, though possibly of similar
socialistic opinions, was Mr. George Bernard Shaw,
whom I long wanted to sit to me.</p>

<p>I had not made the acquaintance of the brilliant
satirist, and somehow hesitated about approaching him.
Eventually I wrote to Mr. Shaw making known my
wish, and, without delay, I received from him a good-humoured
letter, in which he said that it would give
him much pleasure to “join the company of the Immortals.”</p>

<p>A little later he wrote making an appointment,
and, in due course, Mr. Shaw came to my studio and
gave me a delightful hour of his company.</p>

<p>He took up his position on the dais in the most
natural manner, and there was nothing more for me
to do than proceed with my modelling. I do not know
who was the more amused, Mr. Shaw or myself&mdash;I
by his sayings, and he by the novelty of the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>He talked freely as I went on with my work, and
one thing among his many whimsical sayings I well
remember:</p>

<p>“I took to writing with the object of obtaining a
living without having to work for it, but I have long
since realised that I made a great mistake.”</p>

<p>As we walked through the Exhibition he took a general
interest in all he saw, but it was the Napoleonic
relics that detained him, as is generally the case with
distinguished people.</p>

<p>I thought I detected a certain shyness about Mr.
Shaw in the Chamber of Horrors. He was very reserved,
and surveyed the faces of degenerate men and
women without offering any criticism. I remember
that the crafty, and yet not wholly repulsive, face of
Charles Peace engaged Mr. Shaw’s attention several
minutes.</p>

<p>I have no knowledge whether Mr. Shaw ever called
to see his portrait. It is quite likely that he did, and
it is no less likely that his visit passed unobserved.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that so prominent a figure in the
religious world as the late General Booth should find
a place in Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition.</p>

<p>I went to see the General at the instance of some of
his friends, who thought that the portrait of him already
included would be all the better for being brought
up to date. I recollect being impressed by General
Booth’s force of character as manifested alike in his
manner and in his appearance. He had a keen eye and
classic aquiline features.</p>

<p>Though he made no mention of the matter himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
it was pretty plainly hinted to me that permission to
include the General’s portrait should be accompanied
by some expression of gratitude on the part of the
Exhibition authorities “for the good of the cause.”</p>

<p>I also went to Exeter Hall to study the General’s
demeanour while addressing a large audience.</p>

<p>What I remember mostly about that visit was that
a “converted” sailor mounted the platform and made
a rambling speech. So frank were the confessions of
the artless tar that General Booth found it necessary
to bundle him unceremoniously off the platform, to the
great amusement of the congregation.</p>

<p>I was much interested in modelling a quartette of
leading suffragettes, Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Pethick
Lawrence, Miss Christabel Pankhurst, and Miss Annie
Kenney.</p>

<p>The group is conspicuously shown in the Grand Hall
to-day. The ladies came separately, several mornings,
and took as much interest as I did in the production of
their portraits, a process that was in no sense tedious,
as their conversation whiled away the time most pleasantly.</p>

<p>I very soon became aware that the suffragette on
the political warpath is a very different woman from
the suffragette in other circumstances.</p>

<p>None of them in the least degree frightened me or
hectored me; in fact, political questions were discussed
by them in the quietest, most sensible, and most intelligent
manner, giving me the impression then that
the extension of the vote to women would not find such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
women unqualified to make reasonable use of the privilege
so long withheld from them.</p>

<p>After the figures were added to the Exhibition, two
of the four ladies very good-humouredly hinted to me
that the portraits were not very flattering. I remember
the ladies in question coming to see the group, and
I promised I would make what alterations seemed possible
and desirable. As I have not heard from them
since, I gather that the likenesses have proved satisfactory.</p>

<p>Months later, after a batch of laughing damsels
had left the building, a paper disc, bearing the words
“Votes for Women,” was discovered fixed to a button
on Mr. Asquith’s coat.</p>

<p>It was soon after the figures of the quartette had
been placed in the Exhibition that an incident occurred
which comes to me through the medium of a Fleet
Street artist in black and white attached to a well-known
paper.</p>

<p>This gentleman had been instructed to attend a meeting
some distance away from town for the purpose
of taking some sketches of Miss Christabel Pankhurst,
who was announced to speak. Having left things till
the last moment, he discovered, to his dismay, that
he had missed his train, and, not knowing what to do,
he was bewailing his misfortune to a fellow artist,
when the latter slapped him on the back and said:</p>

<p>“Never mind, old fellow, you just go to Tussaud’s
Exhibition and take as many pictures of the fair
Christabel’s figure as you like. The model is a speaking
likeness, and you can take it from me that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sketches will be all right; they will be quite as good
as if drawn from life.”</p>

<p>The advice was no sooner given than acted upon, and
the result, I am told, was most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Another sitter was Mr. T. W. Burgess, who came
to my studio a few days after he swam the Channel.</p>

<p>The burly Yorkshireman laughed as he entered and
remarked:</p>

<p>“I am in pretty good training, but I would rather
swim the Channel again than sit still for you, Mr.
Tussaud. However, I will do the best I can.”</p>

<p>He sold the clothes he took off before he entered
the water, and these clothes are worn by his portrait,
now in the Exhibition. He also parted with the goggles
and indiarubber cap he had worn during his swim, and
the cup from which he took nourishment. Unfortunately
one of Burgess’s too ardent “admirers” purloined
his hero’s cup from us.</p>

<p>Bank Holiday queues&mdash;Cup-tie day&mdash;Gentlemen from the north&mdash;Bachelor
beanfeasts&mdash;The Member for Oldham&mdash;A scare.</p>

</div>

<p>The four regular Bank Holidays of the year are
great occasions at Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>On each of them the precincts of Tussaud’s show
signs of activity long before the average Londoner is
astir. The length of any of the queues has never been
actually measured, but it is no exaggeration to say that
the people have frequently waited four and five deep
in a line extending almost a quarter of a mile&mdash;from
the doors of the Exhibition to the gates of Regent’s
Park.</p>

<p>The crowd at these times consists mainly of Londoners
from all the outlying districts of the Metropolis,
for Madame Tussaud’s has always been in great favour
as a holiday resort for the multitude. Parents also
bring their children in great numbers, and the holiday
crowds continue to come for days after.</p>

<p>There is, however, at least one morning in the year
when the portals of the Exhibition are literally teeming
with life while the citizens are slumbering in bed.</p>

<p>On Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the August Bank
Holiday, and even on Boxing Day, holiday-makers
may be seen at an early hour waiting in a queue, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
no comparison may be made between these crowds and
those of the Cup-tie mornings I have witnessed at the
Exhibition.</p>

<p>This day brings into London tens of thousands of
men and boys from the densely populated manufacturing
towns and mining areas of Lancashire, Yorkshire,
Durham, and Northumberland. These football enthusiasts
arrive in the Metropolis as early in the morning
as two, three, and four o’clock on the day of the
Crystal Palace carnival.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that Madame Tussaud’s
has received the lion’s share of patronage during the
long interval between the arrival of the cheap excursion
trains at the great railway stations and the time when
the Cup-tie is played in the afternoon. The attendance
at these hours is extraordinary, and the appearance
of a house of entertainment in full swing so early
in the morning has an indescribably weird and garish
effect.</p>

<p>These north country patrons of ours take up position
on the steps of the entrance, and pass the time
taking refreshments brought with them from their
homes. Though weary with their journey, they are always
cheery and well-behaved, and the way in which
they banter each other in the broad accents of Oldham,
Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Halifax, Newcastle,
etc., has many a time afforded me a good deal
of interest and diversion.</p>

<p>I have often stood on the broad open staircase and
looked down upon the swarming hundreds in the entrance-hall
and the refreshment rooms and it is a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
experience to dwell on that there has never been occasion
to rebuke any of them for roughness or want of
good behaviour. It is peculiarly true of the country
cousin, so far as my experience of him goes, that he
never indulges in horse-play when he comes to Madame
Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>There is, however, one very striking contrast between
the crowd on a Bank Holiday and that on a
Cup-tie day, and this is due to the circumstances that
the followers of football do not bring their women-folk
or children with them on the occasion of these
“bachelor” beanfeasts&mdash;a concession, I presume, made
to their men by the wives and sweethearts of the north.</p>

<p>Not by a long way do all these excursionists go to
see the great football finals at the Palace. Quite a
large proportion, taking advantage of the cheap fares,
come to see London and its many sights which the
average Londoner proverbially overlooks.</p>

<p>It has more than once been remarked by the Exhibition
attendants that many Cup-tie visitors spend
the greater part of the day at Madame Tussaud’s,
lingering for hours among the relics of Napoleon and
the figures and exhibits of the Chamber of Horrors,
without having the slightest intention of venturing so
far as to see the football contest played.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to imagine that the working classes
of the north are ignorant of English history, or not
concerned with it; and if that impression exists, I
should like to correct it. I doubt whether any class
takes a keener interest in the Hall of Kings, or makes
more use of the information provided by the Catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The “trippers,” “country cousins,” or whatever one
likes to call them, seldom pester the Exhibition attendants
with queries, for what one does not know
another does. The Catalogues are taken away for
further perusal, and one may often search the whole
Exhibition in vain the next morning for one that
has been discarded.</p>

<p>All day long groups of Cup-tie trippers stand about
the Sleeping Beauty, not only for her sake, but also
for the sake of Madame Tussaud, whose figure stands
at Madame St. Amaranthe’s head, while at her feet
sits William Cobbett, wearing his old beaver hat, and
holding in his hand the snuff-box which legend credits
him with passing to visitors on some weird occasions.</p>

<p>Men from Oldham naturally show special interest
in Cobbett, who was, in his day, Member of Parliament
for that town.</p>

<p>Cobbett sits on a red upholstered ottoman, with
room enough for two other persons, and on a certain
Cup-tie day two travel-stained, tired men sat down
by him, and, noticing that he moved his head from
side to side, took him to be alive. They addressed
questions to him, and jumped up very hurriedly as
he jerked his head and looked blankly at them through
his horn spectacles.</p>

<p>The only two figures in the Exhibition that make
any pretence of life are William Cobbett and the
Sleeping Beauty.</p>

<p>A wonderful self-made man was Cobbett, who began
life as a living scarecrow, armed with a shotgun,
in the employment of a farmer, and, after being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
among other things, sergeant-major won a great reputation
as a writer of English prose and attained the
distinction of adding M.P. to his name in those days
when Parliamentary honours were less easily achieved
than they are to-day.</p>

<p>To be sure, the figures of statesmen have always
interested Cup-tie crowds, for the provincial is much
more of a politician than the Londoner.</p>

<p>So also literary men like Scott, Dickens, Tennyson,
Burns, and Kipling come in for much attention; more,
perhaps, than portraits of the clergy.</p>

<p>Sportsmen, too, such as W. G. Grace, Fred Archer,
and “Tommy Lipton”&mdash;the last-mentioned for his
America Cup performances&mdash;receive enough notice on
Cup-tie days to maintain a good average of appreciation
for the year.</p>

<p>As on Bank Holidays, so on Cup-tie days, there are
always many more live than wax figures in the Chamber
of Horrors from morning till night. Indeed, I have
seen the place so crowded that it was difficult to distinguish
the effigies from the awestricken observers.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have taken a walk round the Exhibition
after it was closed on the night of the Cup-tie
to see that all was right. Once I was called in haste
to the Chamber of Horrors, where a stranger had been
found asleep in a dark corner. After he had been
roused and escorted outside, the scared fellow made
off as if he had had the hangman at his heels. A
return ticket from Bolton was picked up where he
had lain. But the man from Bolton had bolted, and
did not return to claim the ticket.</p>

<p>His visit to the Exhibition had been planned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Dr. (now Sir James) Cantlie, of Harley Street, to
whom Sun Yat Sen owed&mdash;the greatest of all debts
of gratitude&mdash;his life.</p>

<p>For it was this same Sun Yat Sen who, eleven years
before, was liberated through the exertions of Dr.
Cantlie from his prison in the Chinese Legation at
Portland Place, a few minutes’ walk from Madame
Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>What would have happened to him but for the
fact that Dr. Cantlie’s intervention resulted in Sun
Yat Sen’s release through Lord Salisbury’s representations
to the Chinese authorities can only be conjectured.</p>

<p>It was discovered at the time that a ship had been
chartered in the Thames for the removal of Sun Yat
Sen to China on a charge of treason against the Emperor&mdash;the
same Emperor whose successor, under a
republican form of government, Sun Yat Sen was
destined to be.</p>

<p>Particulars were also disclosed regarding the manner
of his incarceration at the Chinese Legation. He
was inveigled into the place by the lures of hospitality,
and, once inside, the officials relegated him to an apartment
which they kept locked for many days.</p>

<p>It was only through Sun Yat Sen’s friendship with
Dr. Cantlie, whose suspicions were aroused by “inside”
information, that the British authorities learned
of Sun Yat Sen’s fate and took steps to have him
set free.</p>

</div>

<p>When the hero of this adventure visited Madame
Tussaud’s on the Sunday morning in question to see
his model, I wondered what his reason could be, and
asked myself whether it had anything to do with the
adapting of his disguise, while travelling from this
country to China, at a time when his life must have
been in danger.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it was nothing more than the
natural curiosity which attracts people whose portraits
have been recently added to come and see them. The
Eastern mind may not differ from the Western in this
very human respect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Touching and dramatic in the extreme was the incident
which accompanied the unveiling of the tableau
representing the Gordon Highlanders storming the
Heights of Dargai. Lieutenant-Colonel Mathias’s
words were on all lips at the time:</p>

<p>“That position must be taken at any cost; the Gordon
Highlanders will take it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathias was present with her son and daughter
at the supper we gave to celebrate the event, and
a piper played “The Cock of the North” to recall
the deed of the wounded piper who fired his comrades
on to victory and was awarded the V.C. When his
father’s words were recited, young Mathias sprang to
his feet and thrilled all present by saluting in true
military fashion.</p>

<p>One of the brightest of red-letter days in Madame
Tussaud’s romantic story was the 24th of January,
1907, when Sir William Treloar, “the children’s
Mayor,” accompanied by several local Mayors, drove
to the Exhibition in all the panoply of civic state to
give éclat to the visit of fifteen hundred boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the poorest of the poor, whom we made our guests.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CHILDREN’S LORD MAYOR</p>

<p class="captionsub">Sir William Treloar entertains his little friends at Madame Tussaud’s,
24th January, 1907.</p>

</div>

<p>How richly the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor
of London enjoyed himself on that occasion, like the
large-hearted man he is, and how pre-eminently happy
he was among the waifs and strays, many of whom
were cripples, whose lives he has done so much to
brighten! Sir John Kirk, of the Ragged School Union,
was also there, beaming with joy among his little
beneficiaries. I remember Sir William Treloar pointing
to his civic headgear and calling out to the children,
“How do you like my Dick Turpin hat?”</p>

<p>Tea-tables were laid all among the figures, and the
picture produced in this way was both striking and
amusing as the young people laughed and chatted by
the side of the approving mutes. Perhaps the remark
which seemed to create the greatest fun was when the
Lord Mayor said he would like to see his Sheriffs in
the Chamber of Horrors.</p>

<p>It was very touching to observe the boys loyally
and reverently take off their caps in front of the little
alcove in which Queen Victoria sits, as someone has
said, “signing despatches all day long.” At the close
of the happy day the halls and corridors of the Exhibition
rang with the shrill treble of fifteen hundred
young voices singing “For he’s a jolly good fellow,”
followed by “Hip hip, hooray; the donkey’s run away.”</p>

<p>A tragedy happened that day not far away, in
Westbourne Grove, which caused the gentlemen of
the Press who attended the function to leave the Exhibition
rather hurriedly. News came of the murder
of Mr. William Whiteley, the Universal Provider.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>A miscellany of humour&mdash;Our policeman&mdash;The mysterious lantern&mdash;The
danger of old Catalogues&mdash;Stories of children&mdash;Sir Ernest
Shackleton’s model.</p>

</div>

<p>Many of our visitors will remember the model of
the policeman which stands at the entrance to
the main gallery in the Exhibition. Hundreds&mdash;I
might say thousands&mdash;of visitors have been “taken in”
by this lifelike officer, who is the embodiment of a
genial bobby prepared at any moment to show the way
or tell the time.</p>

<p>The fame of this nameless policeman has extended
to practically all the grown-ups who bring their children
to see the figures, and many times in the day we
see laughing parents watching the nonplussed expression
on the faces of their offspring whom they have
prevailed upon to go and ask where a certain model
is to be found.</p>

<p>Immediately opposite is the figure of the programme-seller
in somnolent mood, who is frequently offered sixpence
for a Catalogue she cannot sell. It is the would-be
customer that is sold.</p>

<p>It is most amusing to observe how many adults
are deceived who seem to pride themselves on their
discernment. For example, on Bank Holidays it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
customary to have a number of real live constables on
duty to regulate the crowd and give directions.</p>

<p>Bobby has a keen sense of humour, and some of
them, entering into the spirit of the situation, now
and again stand stock-still in the most natural attitude
they can command. Not once, but frequently, a visitor,
in passing with his friends, has, with an air of
superior knowledge, pushed the ferrule of his stick or
umbrella into the supposed figure’s side, to be startled
by the model’s ejaculating, “Now then, young man,
enough of that.”</p>

<p>There is a mystery which has never been cleared up,
and that is whether it was a policeman or a burglar
who left a bull’s-eye lantern in the Exhibition studio;
but it is quite clear that the intruder, whoever he was,
fled from the place in fright.</p>

<p>A portrait of the Marquis of Hartington had just
been finished, and left fully clothed and ready to be
transferred to the Exhibition. By an oversight the
door of the studio was left unfastened, and on our
return in the morning it was found to have been
opened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;" id="illus74">

<img src="images/illus74.jpg" width="380" height="570" alt="" />

<p class="caption">MARQUIS OF HARTINGTON</p>

<p class="captionsub">The late Duke of Devonshire.</p>

</div>

<p>On the floor, at the feet of the model of the Marquis,
lay a bull’s-eye lantern that evidently had been
dropped by its owner as he rushed from the place. The
probability is that the policeman, or the burglar, had
flashed his lamp on the figure and had been scared to
find, as he thought, a man&mdash;or a spectre&mdash;confronting
him. No claim was ever made for the lamp.</p>

<p>It is not an unusual thing that visitors who wish to
save expense should bring with them an old Catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
which they have treasured up at home for a future
visit. This is not a safe plan, for with the addition
of new figures the older ones have to be renumbered.
As a result the visitors in question are sometimes misled,
as was the lady in the following story told by a
Londoner.</p>

<p>He related that he had occasion to take a country
cousin to the Exhibition, and she took with her an
old Catalogue.</p>

<p>He paid little attention to her describing King Edward
IV as King Henry VIII, and exclaiming that she
did not know Queen Mary of Scots dressed like a man.
But when she said, “Well, I never! I always thought
Gladstone was a man, though my brothers call him
an old woman,” then he felt interested, and proceeded
to investigate. There it was, sure enough; the model
No. 63 was the figure of an old lady, but in the out-of-date
Catalogue No. 63 was “William Ewart Gladstone.”</p>

<p>Sometimes we get a rough old country farmer who
has got it into his head that everyone in our Exhibition
has committed some crime or other.</p>

<p>Visitors, when audibly perusing their Catalogue,
are sometimes a source of entertainment to others who
overhear them, owing to the curious mistakes they
make. One day a jolly-looking countryman came to
a standstill before the figure of Henry IV of France,
described in our Catalogue as “Henri Quatre.” “’Enry
Carter,” said he; “’oo did ’e kill?” and, finding the
gentleman in question innocent of murder, he turned
away with a disappointed expression, but evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with a fixed determination to discover a genuine criminal
somewhere else.</p>

<p>Not only children, but also their elders, constantly
mistake the policeman, the programme-seller, and the
sleeping attendant for living people; but few children
are so simple as the little maiden who, glancing awestruck
down the long array of very lifelike effigies of
good, bad, and indifferent individuals, asked her mother
in a whisper how they were killed before being stuffed.</p>

<p>One day a lady was explaining the different groups
to her young nephew. Pointing to one, she said,
“Freddy, this is the Transvaal crisis. Here are President
Kruger, Mr. Cecil Rhodes, and Dr. Jameson;
all those people are alive.”</p>

<p>Indicating the next group, she said, “This is the execution
of Mary, Queen of Scots; all these people are
dead.”</p>

<p>“I do not see any difference between the live ones
and the dead ones,” replied the young hopeful to his
auntie, assuming a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>There is no accounting for the actions of children.
Several youngsters, for instance, have been observed
slyly pinching the figures to see if any were alive.</p>

<p>The story is also told of a small girl who, when
asked what she had done with her sweets, replied that
she had given them to the baby in the cradle&mdash;Prince
Edward of Wales.</p>

<p>A child was lost, and found concealed behind the
figure of the Sleeping Beauty, trying to discover the
mechanism that makes Madame St. Amaranthe’s bosom
rise and fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Of children’s stories there is no end at Madame
Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>Sir Ernest Shackleton once told some amusing stories
at a dinner of the Alpine Ski Club.</p>

<p>He said his own small boy was terribly bored with
expedition talk. He told his mother that he wanted
to hear of something really exciting. “I don’t want
to know anything more about papa,” he declared;
“tell me about the baby who was drowned in his bath.”
Was the boy thinking of Marat, the evil genius of the
French Revolution, whom Charlotte Corday stabbed
at his ablutions?</p>

<p>Sir Ernest said that his wife and son had recently
been to see his model at Madame Tussaud’s, but the
child took more interest in General Tom Thumb sitting
on the palm of the Russian giant’s hand than he
did in the portrait of his father.</p>

<p>“Two ladies,” the explorer said, “were standing by
my figure, and the younger one observed, ‘That’s
Latham, the airman.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ replied the other, ‘that is not Latham; it is
the man, you know, who went to the North Pole.’</p>

<p>“It is experiences such as these that keep a man modest,”
said Sir Ernest. The ladies had forgotten his
name and the object of his expedition, which was in
the Antarctic and not the Arctic region&mdash;a distinction
of minor importance to the general public perhaps.</p>

<p>In the days of the Boer War the children of an
illustrious couple who were touring the world fell,
childlike, to discussing the presents their parents would
bring home for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know what I want,” said the youngest of them.
“I want old Kruger’s hat and whiskers, and I believe
papa will bring them to me, because I want to send
them to Madame Tussaud’s.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cyril Maude, the actor, was taken to the Exhibition
when a small boy, and it is recorded of him
that the visit inspired him with the determination to
become an actor. If that were so, then we may congratulate
ourselves.</p>

<p>Some years ago a lady wrote to say that when scolding
her child for being naughty, and impressing upon
her that bad little girls would not go to heaven, the
child naïvely replied, “Well, mother, I can’t expect
to go everywhere, but I’ve been to Madame Tussaud’s.”</p>

<p>The lure of horrors&mdash;Beginnings of the “Dead Room”&mdash;Sir Thomas

</div>

<p class="center"><cite>Crime may be secret, but never secure.</cite>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old Proverb.</span></p>

<p>In citing the old aphorism that society itself creates
the crimes that most beset it, we shall in no way
be tempted to regard the popularity of the Chamber
of Horrors as due to any desire on the part of the
people to visit the place with the object of gazing
upon the result of their own handiwork.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the motives that induce the public
to visit this gloomy chamber scarcely comes within the
scope of this work. But that a very large number <em>do</em>
visit the place in the course of each year, and that they
cannot be deemed to belong to any particular class, but
represent, without distinction, <em>all</em> classes of society,
we may, of our own certain knowledge, aver without
the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>Were we, however, if only from an abstract point
of view, to venture an opinion on the vexed question
as to why so many have a leaning towards the seamy
and sinister side of life, we should be disposed to consider
that, apart from the allurement of the abnormal
and the inclination to indulge a morbid curiosity, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the chief influence serving to stimulate the mind
of the public when a great crime has been perpetrated
in a genuine concern that a serious outrage has been
made on society, constituting a veritable menace to
its security.</p>

<p>We have stated in a former chapter that Curtius,
more than a century ago, had allocated a part of his
Museum in Paris to models of men of ill-repute, and
had named it the “Caverne des Grands Voleurs.” How
far this place approximated to the present Chamber
of Horrors we cannot say, but it certainly must have
created a precedent for the placing of the portraits
and the relics of lawbreakers in a place separate and
apart from the main and more reputable portion of the
Exhibition.</p>

<p>In 1802, when Madame Tussaud crossed the Channel
to establish her Exhibition permanently in this
country, she did not, in all probability, find it easy
to obtain an additional room for these figures, especially
when touring through the provinces. Nevertheless,
when she had to exhibit her models in the same hall,
she undoubtedly differentiated, to the best of her ability,
between the famous and the infamous by grouping
the models of evil-doers in a corner by themselves.</p>

<p>When the Exhibition was opened in Baker Street,
the Chamber of Horrors became a recognised feature
of the collection. It was at first called the “Dead
Room,” although some designated it the “Black
Room,” owing to its sombre aspect.</p>

<p>Its chief exhibit at that time was the guillotine,
surrounded by the impressions of heads that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
decapitated by it. Here also was shown the model of
Marat dying in his bath, besides many other relics of
the Revolution. Indeed, it might have been regarded
as the nucleus of an historical museum dealing exclusively
with the last days of the old French Monarchy.
Even the walls were constructed and draped
in imitation of the interior of the Bastille, the principal
keys of which were shown therein as mementoes of
unusual interest.</p>

</div>

<p>“Mr. Punch” made his début before the British public
somewhere during the early forties, and, as already
indicated, he took an early opportunity of referring to
this part of the Tussaud collection as the “Chamber
of Horrors,” by which title it has been known ever
since.</p>

<p>The number of persons visiting this extra room during
these days was not great, except on those occasions
when the business was galvanised into activity by the
addition of a portrait-model of some unworthy being
who happened for the nonce to figure largely in the
public eye.</p>

<p>There came into our possession at a time beyond
my memory a singular and valuable sketch, by Sir
Thomas Lawrence, of the alleged murderer, Williams,
as he appeared directly after he had hanged himself
in Coldbath Fields prison.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;" id="illus76">

<p class="caption">SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE</p>

<p class="captionsub">President of the Royal Academy.</p>

</div>

<p>Williams was accused of the murders of the Marr
and the Williamson families in the East End of London
under peculiarly brutal circumstances. These
massacres, which were committed in December, 1811,
caused an immense sensation, and inspired the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
monograph of de Quincey entitled <cite>Murder as One
of the Fine Arts</cite>.</p>

<p>How Lawrence came to make such a drawing, and
what induced so refined and dignified a person to interest
himself in a subject so repulsive, it is difficult
to understand. Although Lawrence had not then been
elected to the presidency of the Royal Academy, he
held a high position in society as the first portrait
painter of his day.</p>

<p>We give an illustration of the sketch in question
which is quite authentic.</p>

<p class="captionsub">From a drawing made after he had committed suicide in prison by
Sir Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A.</p>

</div>

<p>Until 1823 it was directed that the body of a suicide
should be buried in a cross-road and have a stake
driven through it, and there can be little doubt that
that of Williams was thus treated. It was not, indeed,
until 1882 that an Act was passed putting an end
to this barbarous custom.</p>

<p>This circumstance readily calls to mind Tom Hood’s
description of the fate that befell Ben Battle, the victim
of Faithless Nelly Gray:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">And they buried Ben in four cross-roads,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With a <em>stake</em> in his inside!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the characters that became, in course of time,
suitable objects for the “Dead Room” we have neither
the space nor the inclination to dwell upon, but a passing
reference to two or three that helped to give the
place its present distinctiveness may prove interesting.</p>

<p>The hideous crimes perpetrated by Burke and Hare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
to which slight reference has already been made, took
place about the year 1828, and the memory of those
crimes was still fresh in the mind of the public when
we opened in Baker Street; indeed, a matter of six
years could not suffice for its obliteration.</p>

<p>The appalling revelation that it was not only possible,
but easy, for one’s neighbour to be decoyed away,
put to death, and his body sold, without question, for
a sum varying from £8 to £14, aroused a feeling of
consternation throughout the country of a very real
and lasting character.</p>

<p>The high prices paid for bodies required for dissection
had begotten this terrible traffic. At least sixteen
murders had been traced to these miscreants, but the
evidence at the trial failed to answer the question “How
many more?”</p>

<p>Burke was executed in January, 1829, on the
strength of Hare’s evidence, so that for nearly a century
have the portrait-models of these two notorious
criminals stood facing each other. There are to this
day many visitors who, on catching sight of their forbidding
features, seem to recognise them, and make
ready comment, without the aid of a Catalogue, on the
leading circumstances associated with their nefarious
careers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus75">

<img src="images/illus75.jpg" width="380" height="325" alt="" />

<p class="caption">BURKE AND HARE</p>

<p class="captionsub">Both notorious criminals who perpetrated a series of gruesome
murders in Scotland before 1828. These models from life by
Madame Tussaud were among the first of contemporary criminals
made by her for the famous “Chamber of Horrors,” then called the
“Dead Room” or the “Black Room.”</p>

</div>

<p>The very first startling event that furnished a subject
for the “Dead Room,” when the Exhibition opened in
Baker Street in 1835, was the attempt on the life of
Louis Philippe, King of the French, four months later.</p>

<p>It had been the custom of His Majesty to review
the Gardes Nationales and the garrison of Paris on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
each anniversary of the Revolution of 1830. For some
considerable time the King and his Government had
been growing very unpopular, and many warnings had
been given him to desist from this military function;
but, in spite of all advice, he persisted in holding the
review.</p>

<p>The anniversary of the Revolution was on the 28th
of July, and the King, followed by a numerous Staff,
left the Tuileries at half-past ten on the morning of
that day, accompanied by his three sons, the Ducs
d’Orléans, de Nemour, and de Joinville.</p>

<p>In passing along the Boulevard du Temple&mdash;and,
strange to say, when almost opposite the site of Curtius’s
old Museum&mdash;a noise was heard resembling an
irregular musket fire. In an instant the road and pavement
at the point where Louis had been riding was
strewn with dead and dying men and horses, and amid
the mêlée the King, slightly wounded in the forehead,
stood alone by the side of his injured horse.</p>

<p>More than forty persons had been struck and nineteen
killed or mortally wounded. Among the latter
was Edward Joseph Mortier, Duc de Trevise, the
famous Marshal of Napoleon I.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ suspense, attention was directed
to a cloud of smoke issuing from the third-floor
window of a house on the Boulevard. Herein was discovered
a machine composed of a row of twenty-five
gun-barrels so arranged as to cover the cavalcade as
it passed the premises. It had been fired by a train
of gunpowder, with the result that several of the barrels
had burst on the discharge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was empty, but from one of the back
windows of the house the police caught sight of a man
huddled up in a corner of the courtyard below. He
was trying to stanch the blood which was flowing
from a great wound in his head. In spite of his injury,
caused by his firing of the infernal machine, he had
had the strength to stagger out of the room, seize a
rope, secure it to a window, and by its means escape
from the house.</p>

<p>The man turned out to be Giuseppe Fieschi, a rabid
conspirator. Our model of him was added some weeks
after the event, and, being placed by the side of an
exact copy of the machine he had used, the man and his
diabolical contrivance proved of considerable interest,
a circumstance that substantially assisted to establish
the Exhibition as a permanent London attraction.</p>

<p>This political crime was, however, soon eclipsed by
one of a particularly sordid character committed much
nearer home.</p>

<p>James Greenacre who murdered his fiancée, Hannah
Brown, by striking her a fatal blow in a fit of temper,
will ever figure as a criminal of a very curious type.
Many a deed like that which brought him to the scaffold
has occasioned but a passing interest. It was
the means he adopted for the purpose of evading the
consequences of his crime that aroused the excitement
and indignation of the people. He dismembered the
body, and deliberately distributed it in broad daylight
to widely different parts of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>The discovery of the various parts of the body from
time to time, the bringing of them together, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
final identification of the remains wrought up the
public mind to a state of high tension, and after the
culprit had been brought to justice many thousands
visited the Exhibition to scan for themselves the features
of his model which had been installed.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we are dealing with a
period when the extreme penalty of the law was exacted
in public, a condition of things which lasted till
1868, when it was enacted that all executions should
take place privately within prison walls.</p>

<p>The night before Greenacre’s execution at Newgate
(the 2nd of May, 1837) hundreds slept on the prison
steps and round about the neighbourhood of the old
gaol. Crowds spent the night in taverns and lodging-houses,
indulging in unseemly revelry and ribald and
drunken dissipation. Nor were the spectators all
drawn from the lowest class; all classes were represented.
Positions within sight of the drop fetched
from five shillings to a couple of guineas each, and a
first-floor room overlooking the scaffold commanded as
much as £12, no small price in those days.</p>

<p>It is a grim story, but who has not been entertained
by the account in the <cite>Ingoldsby Legends</cite> of the way in
which “My Lord Tomnoddy” failed to witness the
launching into eternity of a doomed fellow creature?</p>

<p>Referring back to the days before the advent of the
daily illustrated papers with their portraits of all kinds
of people, a very affecting story was once told by a
well-known author.</p>

<p>It related to a very pretty and plaintive young
woman who visited the Chamber of Horrors early on
the morning that a certain criminal with many <i lang="la">aliases</i>
was executed.</p>

<p>She was accompanied by her father, who, with his
arm about her waist to steady her faltering steps, led
her up to where the figure of the murderer stood. The
poor woman remained gazing at it as though fascinated;
then, with a nod, she burst out crying and buried
her head in her hands.</p>

<p>Her father gently drew her out of the place, and
as he did so whispered in her ear, “Free, my child;
free at last!”</p>

<p>How the author came to hear of the incident we
do not know, or was it one of those coincidences that
somehow do occur?</p>

<p>“The Chamber of Horrors Rumour”&mdash;<em>No reward has been, or will
be, offered</em>&mdash;The constable’s escapade&mdash;A nocturnal experience&mdash;Dumas’s
comedy of the Chamber&mdash;Yeomen of the Halter.</p>

</div>

<p>We have speculated much upon the origin of what
has come to be called “The Chamber of Horrors
Rumour,” relating to a popular delusion that
Madame Tussaud’s will pay a sum of money to any
person who spends a night alone with the criminals
assembled therein.</p>

<p>It need hardly be pointed out that no such ridiculous
challenge was ever issued to the public, although the
rumour has run for nearly twenty years, in spite of
repeated contradictions.</p>

<p>I am not even hopeful that what I am writing now
will produce the desired result of disabusing adventurous
minds of this impression; in fact, denials on
our part appear rather to have tended to give wider
currency to the rumour. Thousands of letters have
been received from volunteers of both sexes eager and
anxious to undertake the ordeal for rewards which
vary, in their imaginations, from £5 to £5,000.</p>

<p>Among the aspirants have been soldiers, sailors,
ex-policemen, and even domestic servants, all of whom
insisted that their nerves were equal to the task. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the other day I received a letter from a Scotsman who
intimated his willingness to forgo any pecuniary reward
if only we would furnish him with a bottle of
whisky and some sandwiches with which to regale himself
as he sat at the feet of Burke and Hare.</p>

<p>The conclusion has somehow taken possession of
our minds that this fallacious rumour emanated, innocently
enough, from a story told long ago by one
“Dagonet” of a man who was said to have been accidently
locked all night in the Chamber. Originally, I
imagine, people must have offered voluntarily to spend
a night there for a consideration, and then, as the subject
came to be talked about, it very easily grew into
the form of a challenge said to have been made by
us, which, of course, was never made and never will
be made.</p>

<p>Considerable fillip was given to the rumour by the
Chamber of Horrors scene in <cite>The Whip</cite> at Drury
Lane Theatre in 1909.</p>

<p>From some source or another handbills in the following
form were plentifully distributed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">£100 REWARD</p>

<p class="noindent">will be given to any person, male or female, who will pass the
night alone in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud’s
Exhibition. The only condition made is that the daring one
shall not smoke or drink or read during the twelve hours he
passes with the wax figures of the world’s noted criminals.</p>

</div>

<p>It was also stated on the handbill that the above
was a copy of a placard said to have been issued many
years ago, but in spite of the large reward, no one came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
forward to try the experiment, and that now, after
many years, “Tom Lambert, the trainer of The Whip,
undergoes this horrible experience in the Drury Lane
drama.”</p>

<p>So far so good, for dramatic purposes&mdash;and that is
all.</p>

<p>Apparently it was something of this sort that the
bard had in mind who wrote the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I dreamt that I slept at Madame Tussaud’s</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With cut-throats and kings by my side,</div>
<div class="verse">And that all the wax figures in those weird abodes</div>
<div class="verse indent1">At midnight became vivified.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Until the recent escapade of a venturesome young
lady, the only instance I can recall of any person
spending the night alone in the Chamber of Horrors
falls accidentally to the credit of a policeman on duty
at the Exhibition when the opening of the present
building was celebrated in July, 1884. A reception
was then held which lasted until after midnight, and
naturally it became necessary that the place should
be guarded till the return of the staff in the morning.</p>

<p>The policeman in question was put in charge of the
criminals in the Chamber of Horrors, with liberty to
relieve the monotony of his eerie vigil by strolling
through the other parts of the building, which included
access to the room in which the refreshments had been
served. Wines and spirits and other good things were
left nominally under his care&mdash;whereby hangs a tale.</p>

<p>When the time came to relieve the policeman in the
morning, he could not be found, and after a long search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
an Exhibition attendant heard the sound of moaning
proceeding from one of the docks in the Chamber of
Horrors. Here lay asleep the missing police-officer, in
a condition that pointed to the probability of his having
had recourse to the wines of the feast, presumably
as a means of fortifying his courage.</p>

<p>The incident caused some little concern, but the
officer’s position was so well understood and the extenuating
circumstances were so obvious that his misadventure
came to be jocularly treated as an excusable
lapse. He had not only spent the night in the dread
abode of criminals, but had actually slept there&mdash;a
much more surprising performance.</p>

<p>Yet another reminiscence of the Chamber of Horrors,
just a little creepy.</p>

<p>Sauntering one night through its gloomy passages
after the last visitor had departed and the watchmen,
having passed me on their rounds, had lowered the
lights to a feeble glimmer, my attention was drawn in
some unaccountable way towards one of the models.</p>

<p>“I could swear that figure moved,” I said to myself.
“But no, the notion is too ridiculous.”</p>

<p>I looked at it again, carefully this time. I was not
mistaken. The figure <em>did</em> move, and, what was more,
it moved distinctly towards me. It appeared to bend
slowly forward, as though in preparation for a sudden
bound, and I thought it looked at me with a fixed
and malignant stare.</p>

<p>Just as I was expecting it to raise its arms and seize
me by the throat, it stopped dead, and remained at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
grotesque and ludicrous angle, apparently looking for
something on the floor.</p>

<p>What was the explanation of this thrilling experience?</p>

<p>The vibration caused by a heavy goods train on the
Metropolitan Railway, which runs under the Exhibition
premises, had shaken the figure off its balance,
and the iron which fastened it to the floor permitted
it to move and lean forward in the uncanny manner I
have described.</p>

<p>The following comedy of the Chamber of Horrors
from which the chief actor derived a minimum of
amusement, if any, comes into my mind as having
been described by the elder Dumas, and is calculated
to relieve the gloom that is naturally associated with
the place:</p>

<p>“A young Parisian, visiting the Exhibition in London,
found himself temporarily alone in the famous
Chamber, and was seized with the ambition of being
able to say, on his return to his favourite Paris café,
that his neck had been held in the same lunette which
had once encircled those of Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette.</p>

<p>“The idea was no sooner conceived than carried
out, and for quite five minutes the rash young man
enjoyed his novel position under the knife of the very
same guillotine which had once worked such havoc
among the aristocrats in the gay city.</p>

<p>“When, however, he was about to touch the spring
that would release him, a thought struck him which
threw him into a cold sweat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Supposing he were to touch the wrong spring,
might not the knife come down, with the result not
only of beheading him, but of making the world believe
a most sensational suicide had been committed?</p>

<p>“He shouted for help, and at length an attendant,
followed by a crowd of visitors, appeared.</p>

<p>“‘What is the matter?’ they asked in English; but
the official was equal to the occasion, and turned it
to good account.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">À l’aide! Au secours!</i>’ yelled the Parisian, who
could only speak French.</p>

<p>“‘A little patience,’ answered the other.</p>

<p>“‘What does he say?’ was the general query.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it’s a part of his performance, ladies and gentleman.
You see, Madame Tussaud is not satisfied
with merely exhibiting the guillotine. She wishes to
show you how it is actually worked.’</p>

<p>“This statement was greeted with general applause
by everybody except the victim, who continued entreating
to be released, whilst the impromptu lecturer
calmly explained to the audience the practical working
of the death-dealing machine.</p>

<p>“‘Bravo! How well he acts!’ was the verdict, as
the prisoner appealed frantically in a language which
none else but the attendant understood.</p>

<p>“Finally, on being at last released, he fainted.
They brought him round with smelling-salts and cold
water, and the first thing he did was to feel if his
head was still safe. Satisfied on this point, he fled,
without stopping to find his hat, and lost not an instant
in starting at once for Paris.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>I come now, by a sudden transition, to write of
three notable shrieval servants whose occupation, however
indispensable, was unsavoury.</p>

<p>Calcraft, the first to be styled the “Yeoman of the
Halter,” I had not the “pleasure” of knowing.</p>

<p>We have the original signboard he used to exhibit
outside his house. It is a framed piece of wood, about
three feet by two feet, and it bears in black letters
the following notice:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">J. Calcraft</span>,</p>

<p class="center">Boot and Shoe Maker. Executioner to Her Majesty.</p>

<p>His successor, Marwood, sat on several occasions
for his model.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus79">

<p class="caption">WILLIAM MARWOOD, THE HANGMAN</p>

<p class="captionsub">Modeled from life.</p>

</div>

<p>The executioner would sometimes visit the studios
when his spirits were low, and a pipe and a glass of
gin and water&mdash;his favourite beverage&mdash;were always
at his service.</p>

<p>Then he would go down to the Chamber of Horrors
to see some of his old acquaintances around whose
necks he had so delicately adjusted the fatal noose.
He would stop before each one with a grim look, while
his lips moved tremulously.</p>

<p>“Put me there,” he once said after he had given
a sitting.</p>

<p>It was like a man choosing the site of his grave.</p>

<p>His companion on these visits was a grizzled terrier.
One day he came alone.</p>

<p>“Your dog, Mr. Marwood&mdash;where is it?” he was
asked.</p>

<p>The old man was sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“My poor old dog is dying&mdash;my dog that knew the
business like a Christian and the inside of every prison
in England; that has played with my ropes; that has
caught rats in my business bags.”</p>

<p>“Dying by inches,” was the unfeeling rejoinder of
a bystander, followed by the cruel suggestion, “Why
don’t you hang him?”</p>

<p>Marwood gave him a reproachful glance.</p>

<p>“No, no. Hang a man, but my dear old dog&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>Poor Marwood had a good heart, and the story of
the dog was so affecting that the interview abruptly
terminated.</p>

<p>Berry, the executioner, was paid for a sitting, and
seemed by no means averse from having his figure
placed in the Chamber of Horrors, where it may now
be seen. He rather appeared to be proud of his official
calling.</p>

<p>As I proceed with my narrative, having already
travelled through the memories of many years,
there seem to crowd at my heels, so to speak, a great
collection of humorous and curious incidents which,
although unrelated to each other, are yet worthy of

when I want to engage in serious work, but no amount
of persuasion will lure them from their lurking-places

a few trivialities that are sufficiently obliging
to present themselves as I write.</p>

<p>In the Berlin Treaty days a staunchly Conservative
borough was celebrating the event, and among other
decorations was a large transparency showing Lord
Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury standing together,
with the motto “Peace with Honour” beneath them.
An old woman went up to the borough M.P. and asked:</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, will you tell me which is Peace?”</p>

<p>Charles Peace was the man of the moment just then.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, according to his cousin, Katherine
Clemens, once visited Madame Tussaud’s. He stood
a long while, says his cousin, in contemplation of an
especially clever piece of work, and was aroused by a
sudden stab of pain in his side. Turning quickly, he
found himself face to face with a dumb-founded British
matron with her parasol still pointed at him.</p>

<p>“O lor’, it’s alive!” she exclaimed, and beat a hasty
retreat.</p>

<p>The best known of all cricketers, Dr. W. G. Grace,
has long enjoyed a well-earned place of prominence in
the Exhibition, and even to-day, when the great master
of the bat and the ball is no longer with us, his portrait
continues to attract more than an average share of attention.</p>

<p>Dr. Grace was very fond of telling the following
story about a trusted old servant of his whom he
treated on one occasion to a trip to London. On her
return he asked her what it was that pleased her most
among the sights of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, Madame Tussaud’s was beautiful,” replied
Susan.</p>

<p>“Then you must have seen me there?” said her
master.</p>

<p>“No, that I did not, sir.”</p>

<p>“What! How did you miss me? I am there as
large as life.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, to tell you the truth, it cost sixpence
extra to go into the Chamber of Horrors.”</p>

<p>A young girl arriving at an institution at Torquay,
from London, was asked whether she had ever visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey. She hesitated, and was then reminded
that that historic edifice contained monuments
of the Kings and Queens of England. She immediately
brightened up, and replied, “Oh, yes, I have
been there, but they call it Madame Tussaud’s now.”</p>

<p>A short time after the seated figure of Mr. Rudyard
Kipling, which is still to be seen in the Exhibition,
had been modelled, the following conversation is reported
to have occurred between a young lady and her
maid, who had visited Madame Tussaud’s:</p>

<p>Relating her experiences there, the girl remarked:</p>

<p>“They’ve got Mr. Kipling and another murderer
there, miss.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Kipling isn’t a murderer,” said her young
mistress.</p>

<p>“No, miss,” was the reply, “but they’ve got him
there, miss.”</p>

<p>During those days when the Exhibition was being
removed from one town to another the figures of
criminals originally stood together in the same room
with all the other models; but as it was suggested
that it was indecorous to have the effigies of criminals
in such close proximity with those of illustrious personages,
Madame Tussaud had the former removed to
a separate room, and the Chamber of Horrors was
formed as it now exists.</p>

<p>The relatives and friends of criminals frequently
visit the Chamber.</p>

<p>At a drawing-room meeting held at the residence
of Lady Esther Smith, in Grosvenor Place, in aid of
the Social Institutes’ Union, which exists to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
facilities for establishing clubs on temperance lines,
Mrs. (now Lady) Bland-Sutton told the story of a
little girl who was asked where she would like to go
for a treat.</p>

<p>“To Madame Tussaud’s,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“But you went there last year,” it was objected.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know,” said the child, “but father wasn’t
in the Chamber of Horrors then.”</p>

<p>Somewhat similar is the following:</p>

<p>A parlourmaid, interviewed by her mistress just
after a Bank Holiday, was asked:</p>

<p>“And how did you spend your day off, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we went to Madame Tussaud’s,” was the
reply. “We always go there, mum. You see, having
uncle in the Chamber of Horrors gives the place
a family interest, so to speak.”</p>

<p>When Dr. Jackson was Bishop of London he gave
a breakfast to several curates before they left to take
up missionary work abroad, and one of them, in the
course of conversation at the repast, observed that
he had just visited Madame Tussaud’s, where he had
heard a figure of his Grace had been on view for
many years.</p>

<p>He said he much regretted that he could not find
the figure anywhere in the Exhibition, although he had
searched for it high and low.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Bishop, “haven’t you heard, my
dear boy, that they’ve melted me down for Peace?”&mdash;a
sally that was greeted with roars of laughter.</p>

<p>Many complaints have been made by foreigners
visiting London regarding the inefficiency of guides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with little or no knowledge of the places with which
they are supposed to be thoroughly acquainted.</p>

<p>For instance, a certain Teuton of great pretensions
brought to Madame Tussaud’s a party of travellers
from a Prussian provincial town, and informed them,
among other things, that Mrs. Maybrick, whose model
was then in the Napoleon Rooms, was a lady connected
with the life of the great Bonaparte.</p>

</div>

<p>At the beginning of hostilities the Kaiser, Count
Zeppelin, and other German objectionables were relegated
to a less conspicuous position than they had
formerly occupied. The enemy had not at that time
gained the animosity which his subsequent acts of
“frightfulness” earned for him, but he soon showed
himself in his true colours.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1910 that a renewed portrait
of the German Emperor had been given a place
of honour, with the Empress by his side, near our own
royal group. Not very long afterwards the British
public began to suspect the Kaiser of evil designs
upon this country, and visitors frequently indicated
their displeasure in front of his model.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of war, naturally enough, came
an outburst of general reprobation, and the atrocities
committed by the German Army and Navy provoked
impulsive patriots to visible and audible manifestations
of anger. More than once the Kaiser had his
figure struck by men, while women shook their fists
and umbrellas in the face of the world’s greatest
homicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, to the Kaiser belongs the distinction
of having been expelled from Madame Tussaud’s
for several months&mdash;a distinction that was
shared by the late Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>This was done in deference to public opinion, which
had become very hostile to their models being shown
at Madame Tussaud’s. Letters had appeared to this
effect in the Press, and one periodical published a large
cartoon showing the Kaiser and his associates in the
prisoners’ dock in the Chamber of Horrors.</p>

<p>Originally four enemy monarchs had pedestals in an
obscure corner of Room No. 4. They were the Kaiser,
the late Emperor of Austria, the Sultan of Turkey,
and King Ferdinand of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The Sultan of Turkey, as an unkind friend remarked,
“found his level in the melting-pot” some
time ago; and the Kaiser twice had to undergo a surgical
operation as the result of bouts with ultra-patriotic
visitors. Ferdinand of Bulgaria also had some
narrow escapes, especially from our “handymen,” who
have a short way with all enemies.</p>

<p>Some time ago my attention was called to the fact
that one of the “spikes” of the Kaiser’s moustache
had been clipped off, giving him a ludicrously woebegone
appearance. I have always suspected the
Colonials of that “cut,” and if I am wrong&mdash;well,
I apologise. Perhaps the “spike” will be heard of
some other day as a souvenir of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Feeling ran so high after the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>
that we readily yielded to the public demand,
and evicted the Huns from the house.</p>

<p>On the 16th of September, 1916, <cite>John Bull</cite> had
addressed to us the following open letter on the subject
of the presence of the objectionable figures:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">To the Directors, Madame Tussaud &amp; Sons, Ltd.,
Baker Street, W.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>Being an admirer of your Moral Waxworks, I am
sure you will excuse me if I indicate a blot upon your
interesting and intellectual display. As a matter of
fact, there are four blots.</p>

<p>They occur in your Grand Hall, No. 4, and they
take the form of effigies representing, with a fidelity
almost lifelike, those malodorous monarchs the Sultan
of Turkey, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, the Emperor
of Russia, and that arch-villain Kaiser Bill.</p>

<p>Do, please, reshuffle the pack, gentlemen. Take the
sinful quartette out of your Grand Hall, which they
desecrate, and place them in that other room of yours
which seems specially designed for their accommodation&mdash;the
Chamber of Horrors.</p>

<p>In the company of Burke and Hare, Charles Peace,
Greenacre, and Wainwright, they will be quite at
home.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Bull.</span></p>

</div>

<p><cite>John Bull</cite> on the 14th of November printed the
following, containing my reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bravo, Tussaud!</span></p>

<p class="center">PATRIOTIC ACTION OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION.</p>

<p>We have received the following interesting letter
from Mr. J. T. Tussaud:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a regular reader of your valuable and most instructive
paper, my attention was drawn to your letter,
addressed to my company, which appeared in your issue
of the 16th September.</p>

<p>“In it you call attention to what you describe as a
blot&mdash;or rather four blots&mdash;upon ‘our interesting and
intellectual display,’ namely, the inclusion of the Sultan
of Turkey, the King of Bulgaria, and the Emperors
of Austria and Germany in our collection of celebrities
and notorieties. Of course, such a letter from such
an influential person could not pass unnoticed, and it
was brought before my Board of Directors at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p>“Prior to the date of your letter the pack had already
been reshuffled, and the figures to which you
refer had been relegated to a much less conspicuous
position than they had previously occupied. When
your letter was penned they were conspiring against
the peace of Europe in a small room which contains the
tableau representing ‘The Destruction of Messina’&mdash;a
scene of ruin which seems to be in keeping with this
Machiavellian group.</p>

<p>“Like yourself, other visitors had frequently suggested
that the quartette should be placed in another
famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;part of the Exhibition; but the
trouble was that Burke and Hare, Charles Peace,
Greenacre, and Wainwright, whom you name, and
their comparatively innocuous companions, would not
hear of their abode being thus desecrated.</p>

<p>“What were we to do?</p>

<p>“I am now pleased to inform you that after considering
your remarks a solution has been arrived at:
the pack has been shuffled again, and, by a remarkable
feat of legerdemain, the four knaves have now disappeared
altogether.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>We congratulate Messrs. Tussaud on this happy solution
to the problem.</p>

</div>

<p>The restoration of two of the figures was due to
a very singular circumstance. Our overseas soldiers
soon began to visit Madame Tussaud’s in large numbers,
and they frequently expressed disappointment
at not being able to see the two enemy Emperors whose
armies they had come so far to fight.</p>

<p>Sympathising with their point of view, we had the
Kaiser and Francis Joseph readmitted, placing them
in an isolated position, with the “All-Highest” at one
time confronting the Messina tableau, and more recently
faced by the tableau of the Ruhleben horse-box
in which British prisoners had to spend four long
weary years of separation from home and family. In
the same room are models of Prince Bismarck and
Count von Moltke.</p>

<p class="caption">PRINCE BISMARCK</p>

</div>

<p>It was some little time after the Kaiser’s reinstatement
that a British sailor, who was quite unable to
control his feelings, after glowering for several minutes
at the figure, made a run at it and knocked it
over. The head was smashed and the figure badly
damaged.</p>

<p>The tar’s friends, who were much concerned at
their companion’s escapade, strove to pacify him, and
contrived to get him out of the building without
further trouble; but the Kaiser had to go into hospital
for repairs.</p>

<p>The sailor was carried away by an impulse thousands
have with difficulty controlled out of respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
for the Exhibition and the law which makes it an
offence to destroy other people’s property.</p>

<p>Two days after the incident a little boy inquired
of an Exhibition attendant where he could see the
pieces of the Kaiser, as he would like to take a bit
away.</p>

<p>A party of twenty-eight American soldiers happened
to be passing the curtained room where the dismembered
model of the Kaiser lay, and one of them made
the request that they should be shown the “All-Highest”
lying in state.</p>

<p>“And a very bad state, too,” replied the attendant,
who could not oblige.</p>

<p>The second serious attack upon the Kaiser’s effigy
took place two or three months after the first.</p>

<p>On this occasion it was a Colonial soldier who, seeing
the restored monarch gazing at him in a supercilious
fashion, as he imagined, drew from its scabbard the
sword of the defunct Austrian Emperor, whose model
sits close by, and stabbed the Kaiser’s figure in the
face.</p>

<p>The force with which the thrust was delivered was
such that off came the monarch’s head, and again
the model had to be taken to hospital for the surgical
operation of restoring the head and refixing it to its
trunk.</p>

<p>Count Zeppelin, whose name will for ever be associated
with the introduction of aerial warships and
the dropping of bombs upon defenceless people, has
had many a clenched fist shaken at him standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
there beside the portraits of Roger Casement and
Tribich Lincoln.</p>

<p>Though never actually assaulted, it was only the
stolidity of the British character that kept people’s
hands off his effigy during the Zeppelin raids on
London. Visitors were too proud, I suppose, to touch
him, and from the time the first German airship was
brought down in flames on British soil Count Zeppelin’s
model began to be ignored.</p>

<p>A British matron quietly remarked, as she stopped
an instant in front of the portrait, “So you’re going
the way of all our enemies&mdash;beaten at your own
game.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early months of the war we borrowed from
a soldier an Iron Cross that he had taken from the
breast of a dead German officer whom he had found
lying in a wood at Zillebeke, near Ypres, in November,
1914.</p>

<p>According to the story of the soldier&mdash;Drummer
Newman, of the Grenadier Guards&mdash;our men, comprising
Grenadier Guards, Irish Guards, and Oxfordshire
Light Infantry, were opposed to the Prussian
Guards, who were driven out of the wood, leaving
behind them several hundreds of their dead.</p>

<p>Newman was searching for despatches when he happened
upon the cross in question. I remember him
coming to my studio with the trophy. He was a
typical soldier, and he greatly amused me by his
description of the way in which old soldiers&mdash;bearing
in mind one of the trite sayings of Frederick the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Great&mdash;would hearten their comrades, saying, just
before going over the top, “Now then, boys, you don’t
want to live for ever, do you?”</p>

<p>The Iron Cross was exhibited with other relics,
and used to be handed round for inspection, until one
day it was missing. That was in October, 1915, and,
although we made inquiries of the police and learned
that it had been seen in the neighbourhood of the
Exhibition, we heard no more of it till, several months
later, it was traced by detectives to a gentleman at
Warrington who had innocently purchased it from an
invalided soldier.</p>

<p>We willingly refunded the amount that had been
paid for the cross, and it has now been restored to
our collection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No sooner was London subjected to the terrible
ordeal of air-raids than we received, as was only to
be expected, offers of bombs that had been dropped
by enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we acquired one of the first
of these missiles, and it proved of great interest to
our visitors, especially to our own airmen, who never
tired of describing to their friends the construction
of the bomb and the way in which it was dropped.</p>

<p>We found it necessary, however, to discourage the
bringing of ammunition to the Exhibition, as we had
no desire that the building should be wrecked by the
untimely explosion of a live bomb or shell.</p>

<p>Reverting for a moment to the attacks upon the
effigy of the ex-Kaiser, I am reminded of one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
occasions when figures have incurred the animosity of
beholders, although not to the same extent.</p>

<p>A professional rider, expelled from the Jockey Club,
used to visit the Exhibition very often for the sole
purpose of venting his spleen against the image of his
supposed enemy, Fred Archer, the jockey who won
five Derbys; and he was heard to remark that it was
“so like the beggar, I would give anything to smash
it.”</p>

<p>In August, 1893, an old man, whose whole get-up
spoke of better days, was seen to walk up to the effigy
of the late Jabez Spencer Balfour, shake his withered,
palsied fist in its face, and totter out of the building.</p>

<p>Tussaud’s during the war&mdash;Chameleon crowds&mdash;The psychology of
courage&mdash;Men of St. Dunstan’s&mdash;Poignant memories&mdash;Our watchman’s
soliloquy.</p>

</div>

<p>Under the stress of war many strange things
revealed themselves at Tussaud’s&mdash;things by no
means easy to define, subtle, illusive, immaterial, difficult
to comprehend and hard to describe.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities the attendance suffered
a severe check. This disquieting effect was in the
main, I believe, due to the great wrench suffered by
the public mind through the country’s sudden transition
from the normal condition of peace to a strenuous state
of war. But as each month passed the flow of visitors
steadily increased in volume, until it far exceeded that
of pre-war days.</p>

<p>By the time the manhood of the Empire had, in a
great measure, doffed its sombre everyday suit and
donned khaki, khaki became the dominant colour of
the throng that filled the Exhibition rooms.</p>

<p>With this change in attire there came a marked
alteration in its demeanour. Usually sedate and reserved,
it now betrayed&mdash;in startling contradiction to
all reasonable expectations&mdash;a cherry, devil-me-care
character which, curious to relate, resolved itself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
a tone unmistakably flippant; a mental attitude to
which we soon realised we must give our careful consideration.</p>

<p>He would indeed have been a poor psychologist who
had taken this outward showing as a true indication
of the feelings of our brave fellows; for it was obviously
but the assumption of that demeanour so
strongly characteristic of the British disposition, that
of facing an ugly job in a cheerful spirit.</p>

<p>It was the ready answer to the pessimist, “If it’s got
to be done, what’s the use of being miserable about
it?”&mdash;a philosophical bearing that perhaps found its
deepest expression in their “Cheerio!” and insouciant
wave of the hand bidding farewell to wife, mother, and
child ere turning to face the grim realities and dread
uncertainty of war.</p>

<p>To keep pace with the stirring and ever-fluctuating
events of the day, large maps of the battle areas were
specially produced for the Exhibition, and lectures
were given before them, explaining our varying fortunes
in the great conflict. It was in the giving of
these lectures that we were soon able to take a fairly
correct measure of the disposition of our visitors.</p>

<p>They were, first of all, delivered on somewhat
academic lines, with, perhaps, too pronounced an idea
of imparting instruction rather than that of affording
entertainment. It was soon found that if the
attention of our visitors was to be held, it was necessary
to adopt a more optimistic and lively, if not an
almost bantering, tone if the dissertation were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
receive any real mark of appreciation on the part of
those who cared to listen.</p>

<p>As the struggle proceeded Tussaud’s began to assume
the position of a <i lang="fr">pointe de réunion</i> of a very remarkable
character, and this quite irrespective of class
or nationality.</p>

<p>We opened our doors as early as eight o’clock in the
morning, and even then found that not a few had
been waiting for admission for some considerable time.
This forced upon us the conviction that the Exhibition
had risen in favour as something of a place of refuge
by those who had involuntarily found themselves
abroad early in the morning and had borne its existence
in mind.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, throughout all hours of the day
Tussaud’s proved a centre of attraction to many champions
of their country’s cause. Here they were to be
seen, whether on their final leave before going out to
the front, or homeward bound to enjoy a brief respite
from the turmoil of the conflict, and awaiting a train
to carry them to their families.</p>

<p>During the autumn of 1914 and far into the following
year there congregated within our walls numerous
hapless and pathetic beings, strangers to us by their
foreign tongue, who, having come from nowhere in
particular and having nowhere in particular to go,
aimlessly wandered into the Exhibition.</p>

<p>We can only presume that they came to help pass
away many a sad and anxious hour, or maybe to take
measure of the semblance of those who were at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
very moment foremost in striving to stem the tide of
the cruel incursion that had driven them to take refuge
in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Then as time wore on there came a touch of relieving
colour that showed itself here and there amid
the prevailing khaki; at first a mere fleck that gradually
became more pronounced as the war advanced. This
was the hospital blue of our valiant soldiers who had
not passed unscathed through the ordeal of fire, as
cheery a gathering as ever set foot within the place, a
cheeriness readily responded to by their fellow visitors
through the medium of sympathy and admiration.</p>

<p>One sad sight there was, however, which touched
the hearts of the people so deeply that no display of
cheerfulness on the part of the sufferers&mdash;and they,
too, were invariably light-hearted&mdash;could quite evoke
a sense of mirth.</p>

<p>St. Dunstan’s Hostel for Blinded Soldiers and
Sailors in Regent’s Park is not very far from Madame
Tussaud’s, and many of its inmates visited the Exhibition,
and, for the matter of that, still find a
pleasure in coming in couples or small parties to spend
an hour or so among the models and the relics.</p>

<p>In spite of the distressing fact that they have been
deprived of the gift of sight, they stand in front
of the models and pause while the biographies are
read out to them from the Catalogue by some more
fortunate companion. Then they almost invariably
nod to express their comprehension of the subject before
them, and seem to see and understand through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the faculty of their imagination much that would otherwise
have been made manifest to them through the
function of their eyes.</p>

<p>During the past few years our attendance has
totalled to a figure reaching several millions; but the
number visiting the place hardly constitutes so remarkable
a fact as the many diverse nationalities and tribes
they represented, or their coming from so many far-distant
and remote parts of the world.</p>

<p>The landing of a fresh contingent at any one of
our ports, or the arrival in London of any body of
men attached to our Allied Forces, brought distinct
and unfamiliar types of humanity to our doors.</p>

<p>“I had often heard of the place, but never thought
I should have had an opportunity of seeing it,” was a
remark that often fell upon the ears of our attendants;
and we know, for many reasons, that most of them
had made up their minds to visit the place long before
they had set foot upon our shores.</p>

<p>Of the many telling experiences of the last few
momentous years, the one that will be retained longest
in our memory will most assuredly be the touching
sight of the war-stained and weary men who,
during the earlier days of the war, literally stumbled
through our turnstiles into the building.</p>

<p>Dazed for want of sleep, begrimed and besmeared
with the very mud of the trenches, they flung themselves
upon the nearest ottoman or couch, or in some
out-of-the-way place upon the floor, to snatch a few
hours’ sleep in comparative comfort.</p>

<p>One evening, when strolling round the rooms some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
time after the place had been closed, I found myself
looking at the watchmen, who were busily engaged
sweeping the floors. The chief among them, an old
and valued servant, possessing a disposition that generally
enabled him to look upon the bright side of
things&mdash;although he was so often constrained to view
them only during the sombre hours of the night&mdash;caught
me gazing at him.</p>

<p>With a face I thought unusually grave he bade me
“Good-evening,” and ruefully remarked, “It seems to
me, sir, some of this dirt has come a long way.” Then,
pondering for a while, with his eyes fixed upon the
floor, he resumed, “Yes, sir, some of it from the very
trenches.” And I somehow believed the old fellow
was right.</p>

<p class="captionsub">A Portrait Study by John T. Tussaud.</p>

</div>

<p>Nurse Cavell, Jack Cornwell, and Captain Fryatt
will always be remembered with esteem by the present
generation, and the great story of their heroic deeds
ensures for them a permanent home at Baker Street,
where they will be viewed with patriotic pride by
posterity. The portrait of Edith Cavell, the martyr-nurse,
was modelled immediately after that heroic
woman was brutally shot by the Germans at Brussels
at two o’clock in the morning of Tuesday, the 12th of
October, 1915.</p>

<p>I communicated with the London Hospital, Whitechapel,
where Nurse Cavell had served before she went
to Belgium, and the nurses there readily afforded me all
the information they had to impart.</p>

<p>Several of them visited my studio and gave me
valuable hints as to the posing of the figure and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
general demeanour of Miss Cavell when at the hospital.
They particularly described the way in which
she used to walk through the wards with a book under
her arm and her head inclined slightly to one side.
When the model was finished they were good enough
to say that it enabled them to visualise Miss Cavell as
they knew her, and that it was a pleasing portrait.</p>

<p>My wife prepared the laurel wreath, placed above
the model, on which are inscribed Nurse Cavell’s words,
uttered a few hours before her death, “I am happy to
die for my country.”</p>

<p>Soon after the boy hero of the Jutland naval battle
was modelled and he had been awarded the posthumous
honour of the Victoria Cross, his mother, accompanied
by a lady friend, came to the Exhibition to
see the figure of her son. It was on the 24th of
August, 1916.</p>

</div>

<p>No sooner did Mrs. Cornwell catch sight of the
image of her young hero than she burst into a fit of
weeping, and exclaimed, “My boy, my dear boy!”
Upon resuming her composure she expressed her surprise
at the remarkable resemblance, and added: “I am
very proud of my boy, but I do miss him so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cornwell had with her a letter she had received
from the Captain of H.M.S. <i>Chester</i> (her son’s
ship). He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I know you would wish to hear of the splendid fortitude
and courage shown by your boy. His devotion
to duty was an example to all of us. The wounds,
which resulted in his death within a short time, were
received in the first few minutes of the action. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
remained steady at his most exposed post at the gun,
waiting for orders. His gun would not bear on the
enemy; all but two of the crew were killed or wounded,
and he was the only one who was in such an exposed
position. But he felt he might be needed, as indeed he
might have been; so he stayed there, standing and
waiting under heavy fire with just his own brave heart
and God’s help to support him.</p>

</div>

<p>For the model of Captain Fryatt, of the Great Eastern
Railway steamer <i>Brussels</i>, I had to rely mainly
upon photographs.</p>

<p>This brave seaman was captured, with his vessel,
by the Germans on the 23rd of June, 1916. On the
27th of the following month he was condemned to
death at Bruges for attempting to ram a German
submarine, the sentence being carried out the same
afternoon.</p>

<p>The model appropriately stands near that of Mr.
Havelock Wilson, the sailors’ champion, and, judging
from the remarks of visitors who knew the Captain

with these figures the revered names of Lord Roberts

The attitude of visitors towards them is that of deep
admiration and respect, expressed not so much by word

to the public sympathy with these great warriors.</p>

<p>Enclosed in a glass case is a walking-stick to which
belongs a story showing the kind-heartedness of Queen
Alexandra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the war the Queen-Mother visited the
wounded Indian soldiers in hospital at Brighton, and,
noticing that one of the officers limped, she inquired
of him how he come by his injuries. The officer produced
his aluminium ration-box, and explained that a
German bullet had struck it, scattering fragments of
the metal into his leg and other parts of his body.</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra’s sympathy with the Indian officer
took a practical form, as she presented him with her
own walking-stick to aid him during convalescence.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the officer returned to the
front, and a brother officer brought the walking-stick
to us, as he thought Madame Tussaud’s was the best
place for it, so that the public should be constantly
reminded of Queen Alexandra’s deed of kindness.</p>

<p>The stick bears on a silver plate the initial “A,”
surmounted by the royal crown.</p>

<p>The incident reminds me of another in connection
with the same gracious lady which occurred many
years ago, when the Exhibition was at the old Portman
Rooms in Baker Street.</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra, who was then the Princess of
Wales, had been visiting the Exhibition, and was leaving
the building when a poor flower-girl, with a baby
in her arms, approached her and, before anyone could
intervene, held a small bunch of violets close to the
Princess’s face, saying, “Buy a bunch of violets, please,
lady.”</p>

<p>Instead of being annoyed, the Princess accepted the
flowers with her usual sweet smile, handed the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
half-a-sovereign, and then entered her carriage and
drove away.</p>

<p>The astonished girl kept looking at the coin in her
hand, and was quite alarmed when she was told she
had held her flowers under the nose of the Princess
of Wales; but the remembrance of the Princess’s smile
soon reassured her, and she went away happy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early days of the war the late Duke of
Norfolk, the Duchess, and their two children, the
young Earl of Arundel and his sister, Lady Mary
Howard, formed a quartette of most interested spectators,
and were conducted over the place by the
gentleman who had been appointed as War Lecturer
to the Exhibition.</p>

<p>He devoted most of his attention to the young people,
and relates how the Earl and his sister passed
unobtrusively among the exhibits, gaily chatting all
the way, no one but he recognising the ducal party.</p>

<p>The Earl was shown, and allowed to handle, a
German rifle, then recently captured in Belgium, and
he instantly pretended to load the weapon. Then,
raising it to his shoulder, he took a level aim at the
head of the Kaiser and clicked the trigger.</p>

<p>As the party were retiring, his Grace and the Duchess
had a brief consultation, after which the Duke
came back to thank the lecturer for the attention he
had given his son and daughter.</p>

<p>There were sovereigns in those days, and his Grace
offered one to the cicerone, who deferentially declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the gift, saying he had been amply rewarded by the
pleasure of the young people’s company. “I told
the Duchess you wouldn’t take it,” said the Duke,
laughing.</p>

<p>A crinoline comedy&mdash;Mr. Bruce Smith’s story&mdash;An American lady’s
shilling&mdash;My father’s meeting with Barnum&mdash;The “cherry-coloured
cat”&mdash;Paganini and the tailor&mdash;George Grossmith poses.</p>

</div>

<p>In the dressing of the models attention must naturally
be paid to the varying styles of both sexes.
For this reason visitors are able to mark the changes
Dame Fashion has decreed.</p>

<p>The crinoline period known to our mothers was,
curiously enough, anticipated in the days immediately
preceding the French Revolution, as exemplified by
the quaint Parisian coquette, Madame Sappe, with
whom that egoistic old cynic, Voltaire, is palpably
flirting in the Grand Hall, a few paces removed from
the portraits of Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie
Antoinette.</p>

<p>The crinoline of Madame Sappe brings vividly to
mind an amusing story related by my granduncle
Joseph, who was standing by the turnstiles when a
portly matron waddled towards the pay-table, wearing
an exaggerated example of this spacious skirt. Her
passage aroused some curiosity, and the shuffling of
her feet was accompanied by an unaccountable sound
of pattering which disposed my relative to keep her
under observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as she found herself among the figures and
hidden from view, as she imagined, the buxom dame
cautiously raised her crinoline, when, to my uncle’s
amazement, out stepped two little boys.</p>

<p>Nothing was said to the adventurous woman who
had thus passed her offspring into the Exhibition free,
and my uncle used to say that the expression on her
face at the success of her subterfuge was one of radiant
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce Smith, the popular artist, who has produced
many scenic effects in our tableaux, tells a story
perhaps against himself.</p>

<p>He was engaged, with several fellow artists, on a
hunting scene, when an elderly lady and a friend
strolled quietly past. Mr. Smith, at the moment, was
standing stock-still, scanning his work; then suddenly
making a motion with his brush to retouch the canvas,
he was startled by an unearthly yell from the old lady:</p>

<p>“Good heavens! they are alive!”</p>

<p>Our “Master of the Robes” fell in conversation
with an American lady, who told him that she had
paid for admission with a shilling given to her in the
States by an English aunt with the instruction that
if ever she went to London the shilling should be expressly
spent on her admission to Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>She had related the same story to the money-taker
at the turnstile, and he was so impressed that he laid
the romantic shilling on one side. Our representative
offered to give it back to the lady, but she thanked
him and said:</p>

<p>“No, I guess I could not break faith with my aunt!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
The shilling has found its appointed place in Madame
Tussaud’s till, after many years, and I have done
as I was told.”</p>

<p>My father’s meeting with Phineas Taylor Barnum,
the great showman, was an accidental one.</p>

<p>While lunching in a West End restaurant the
brusque and humorous behaviour of one of the guests
sitting near enlisted my father’s amused attention. The
waiters were no less amused by the breezy visitor with
the American accent, who supplemented his commands
with odd remarks. Having ordered a second dozen
of oysters, the American said:</p>

<p>“I guess I could hanker arter these. Bring me another
dozen.”</p>

<p>Looking hard at him, my father recognised Barnum,
and presently the two men were in friendly conversation;
in fact, they spent the greater part of the day
together, as kindred spirits are apt to do in such circumstances.</p>

<p>Barnum used to call himself the “Prince of Humbugs,”
and gave that title to his autobiography. He
told my father a story about a bright idea that struck
him when his show was going none too well in an
American town.</p>

<p>He put up an announcement, “Come and see the
cherry-coloured cat,” and imposed an extra charge
for the privilege.</p>

<p>There was almost a riot as Barnum showed the
people a black cat. They protested, and demanded
their money back; but he coolly asked them whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
they had never seen a black cherry, and so appeased
their wrath.</p>

<p>Barnum sat to me in the spring of 1890, about
a year before he died, and I think I must give him the
palm for being the most entertaining of all my subjects,
his reminiscences extending over so long and
interesting a period. I remember him telling me that
many years before he had tried to induce my grandfather
to transport Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition
to New York, but that the negotiations fell through
at the last moment.</p>

<p>As I modelled him he gave me some gentle hints
not to be too attentive to the wrinkles on his face,
from which I inferred that the old showman possibly
thought he looked older than he felt, in spite of his
silvery hair and four-score years.</p>

<p>A short-sighted tailor was once employed to repair
the coat worn by Paganini, who stood with the violin
under his left arm, while the bow was held aloft in his
right hand.</p>

<p>The figure was on a tall pedestal, and the knight
of the needle had to use a step-ladder. One of the
attendants, ever ready for a joke, taking advantage of
the tailor’s infirmity, removed the figure, and, adopting
a similar attitude, stood in its place.</p>

<p>The tailor prepared his thread, mounted the steps,
and was about to begin stitching when the supposed
figure brought the bow down on his victim’s back. This
so terrified the unfortunate man that he rolled down
the ladder on to the floor, where he sat gazing up with
the utmost stupefaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>All attempts to pacify him were for a time futile,
and whenever he passed the figure of Paganini afterwards
he invariably sidled away from it with a
scared look.</p>

<p>Another practical joker was the late George Grossmith.</p>

<p>It is on record that he once made the Exhibition the
scene of his operations. Getting into an advantageous
nook, he stood stock-still in a line with other celebrities&mdash;waxen
ones. People going by stopped and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, Grossmith; Capital likeness! How excellent!
Dear little Grossmith, one would think he was alive!”
and various remarks of the kind. Then suddenly the
effigy nodded grotesquely, and slowly extended a comic
Grossmithian hand. Everyone fled as though he had
been shot at.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the House of Commons (Mr. J. W.
Lowther), at a banquet given by the Institution of
Civil Engineers, in Middle Temple Hall, on the 23rd
of March, 1898, told of a distinguished visitor to London
who mistook Madame Tussaud’s for the House
of Commons.</p>

<p>Much the same view must have been taken by a
genial and sociable diplomat from the United States
who, soon after his arrival in London, came to Madame
Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>“And what do you think of our great Exhibition?”
asked a friend.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the General, “it struck me as being
very like an ordinary English evening party.”</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>We visit the Old Bailey for mementoes&mdash;A mock trial&mdash;Relics of
Old Newgate&mdash;Two famous cells&mdash;The Newgate bell.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as I learned in the winter of 1903 that
the Old Bailey was to be demolished and its
mementoes sold by auction, I hastened to the historic
court-house, armed with a catalogue, to tick off such
articles as might be wanted for Madame Tussaud’s.</p>

<p>The grim building brought many impressive scenes
to my recollection, and it struck me as a curious freak
of fate that the place where house-breakers had been
tried and sentenced should now be itself in the hands
of the “house-breakers.”</p>

<p>The Royal Arms and the Sword of Justice had been
taken down, and the walls behind the judge’s seat
had been stripped of their faded hangings, giving to
the old court an air of desolation; while the removal
of the doors and windows admitted the chilly blasts of
that bleak February day.</p>

<p>From court to court I passed, noting the catalogued
items that attracted me. I observed the long form,
covered with black, time-worn leather, where I sat
on the occasion of my first visit, thirty years before,
a sensitive and imaginative youth, contemplating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
awe and a strange depression of spirits the final stages
of a murder trial.</p>

<p>Then, as now, it was the interests of Madame Tussaud’s
that sent me to the Old Bailey, and it may seem
odd to confess that of all my many duties none ever
afforded me less real pleasure than such duties as this.</p>

<p>This time my visit was unexpectedly relieved by
an amusing incident which might have served for a
scene in a melodrama.</p>

<p>I came upon a bevy of workmen, in charge of a
jovial carpenter, improvising a mock trial to pass the
time between the conclusion of a meal and the resumption
of their work.</p>

<p>Presently I heard a scuffling noise and the voice of
someone in distress. A lanky old man was being
forced by a couple of fellow workmen into the prisoners’
dock, obviously on some sort of vamped-up
charge.</p>

<p>“Silence!” shouted a shrill-voiced little man, wearing
an apron and paper cap, who had made himself
usher of the court.</p>

<p>I looked towards the jury-box, and there saw a
droll-looking individual finishing his dinner out of a
newspaper.</p>

<p>“Stop that row! Such conduct is disgraceful in a
court of justice,” he called, looking across at the struggling
prisoner.</p>

<p>Then, observing himself to be alone, the occupant of
the jury-box managed to empanel six of his friends to
make seven “good men and true.” The jurymen came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
forward from different sheltered parts of the court,
bringing with them what remained of their meal.</p>

<p>As by some prearranged signal, an elderly man,
with a round, red face, quietly slipped into the judge’s
seat, assuming a judicial air, and fixing his stem gaze
upon the protesting prisoner in the dock. The judge
paid no attention to the banter directed to him by a
number of workmen who constituted the “public” and
had sauntered in to enjoy the sport.</p>

<p>His “lordship” took on himself the duties of judge
and clerk of the court, and gravely recited a long,
and terrible indictment of the accused, who might
have been some arch-fiend from the list of crimes
charged against him&mdash;a list that seemed to box the
compass of the Ten Commandments. He was involved
in domestic complications which drew forth groans
from all in court, and the judge’s reference to his “poor
dear wife and little innocent children” evoked well-simulated
execration.</p>

<p>A comical fellow entered the witness-box, and reminded
the prisoner of a blood-curdling murder he
had committed years ago, for which somebody else had
been hanged. The witness paused, and then, bringing
down his first, said, “Worse than all this, my lord,
<em>’e’s been known to work overtime without extra pay</em>.”</p>

<p>While these harrowing details were visibly moving
the jury, the clocks of the neighbourhood struck the
close of the dinner hour, and the whole seven men with
one accord jumped to their feet shouting “Guilty!”
adding, “No recommendation to mercy.”</p>

<p>The judge put on a billycock hat in imitation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the black cap, and addressed the prisoner with due
solemnity to this effect:</p>

<p>“Prisoner at the bar, we regret we cannot ask you
whether you have anything to say. Justice has no
time for that. A jury of your countrymen has found
you guilty, and they know best. My duty is to order
you to be taken to a public-house near at hand, where
you are very well known, and at a certain hour you
shall buy drinks for everyone in this court, including
myself, the jury, and whatever members of the public
care to be present. If you fail to turn up at the appointed
time and place, may the Lord have mercy on
your stingy soul!”</p>

<p>In the course of a few days the Old Bailey jury-box
and several other fittings of the ancient criminal
court were installed under the roof of the Exhibition.
The prices they fetched were hardly more than nominal.</p>

<p>It was very different, however, with the relics of the
adjoining prison. The mementoes of Old Newgate
found many eager buyers, and the bitter February
weather did not prevent a large crowd of bidders following
the auctioneer about as he crossed the bleak
prison yard and passed through the long dreary corridors.</p>

<p>The bidders came from all classes of society, bent
on obtaining some keepsake of the sombre establishment.
I see that procession now, some muffled to the
ears, some blowing their finger-tips in the piercing
cold, others stamping their feet, but all indulging in
one form of humour or another to keep up their spirits
in very dispiriting surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>There were three lots on which the crowd bestowed
special attention.</p>

<p>One was Jack Sheppard’s cell, from which he made
his daring escape&mdash;a thrilling feat dear to the imagination
of boys young and old.</p>

<p class="caption">JACK SHEPPARD, THE HIGHWAYMAN</p>

<p class="captionsub">This model is posed in the actual cell from the Newgate prison, from

</div>

<p>Another lot was the cell in which Lord George
Gordon, the instigator of the riots that bear his name,
died of gaol fever on the 1st of November, 1793.
His exploits will be remembered by readers of <cite>Barnaby
Rudge</cite>.</p>

<p>The third lot was the famous bell which, for just
upon a century and a half, had never failed to notify
the good citizens of London the precise moment when
a condemned prisoner had paid with his life for a life
he had taken.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD NEWGATE BELL</p>

<p class="captionsub">Acquired by Madame Tussaud &amp; Sons, Ltd., when the prison was
demolished in 1903.</p>

</div>

<p>There was an idea at the time that the metal of
the Newgate bell contained in it a quantity of silver,
and this belief gave rise to the impression that it
would fetch a high price.</p>

<p>But it fell to our bidding, amid a hearty burst of
approval, for the round sum of £100, by no means a
high price for such a coveted relic.</p>

<p>Not only the bell, but also the cells, came into
our possession that day. The thick solid masonry
and heavy iron work were taken down and carefully
marked, so that each part should be set up again in
its right position when installed at Madame Tussaud’s&mdash;a
tedious process that incurred a far greater outlay
than the original cost.</p>

<p>Satisfaction was widely expressed that the Newgate
relics should find their way into Tussaud’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>These memorials of Old Newgate have already
reposed in their new home sixteen years, and have been
viewed by millions of people who otherwise would
not have had an opportunity of seeing them.</p>

<p>Visitors of all grades of society linger long before
these narrow cells, and I have often seen them rap
with their knuckles the Newgate bell, which never fails
to respond with a soft mellow resonance, reminding
one of the time-honoured couplet, deeply inscribed
upon it:</p>

<p>One thing is to be noted about the last two quotations:
the writer gives the right pronunciation to

<div class="hanging">

<p>Last scene of all&mdash;Madame Tussaud’s appearance and character&mdash;Her
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, published in 1838&mdash;Her last words.</p>

</div>

<p>If I have recounted many stories relating to incidents
that have taken place long after Madame
Tussaud passed away, it is because the flow of anecdote
prompted by her genius has continued in an unbroken
course down to the present times.</p>

<p>But the atmosphere of romance that pervades this
history belongs in the main to her days, and it is only
fitting that with the close of her days it should practically
come to an end.</p>

<p>She died some eight years before I was born, but
from my father and from those of his generation who
spent the best part of their lives in her company I
learnt so much about her that it is difficult for me
to realise that I had not enjoyed her personal acquaintance.
Her model that stands at the head of the “Sleeping
Beauty,” I have always been given to understand,
is a speaking likeness.</p>

<p>In figure she was small and slight, and her manner
was vivacious. Her complexion was fresh, her hair
dark brown with never more than a sprinkling of
grey, and her soft brown eyes were keen and alert
when her interest was aroused. She was a great talker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
her conversation was replete with reminiscences, and,
moreover, she was blessed with a faultless memory.
Austere in her habits of life, exacting in her likes
and dislikes, she showed a ready sympathy with those
in distress, and, above all, she was generous to a fault.</p>

<p>Unfortunately her <cite>Memoirs</cite>, published in 1838, although
they were penned more than a decade before
she died, do not bring us into any very close relationship
with either her personality or her life.</p>

<p>This would not be surprising to those who knew
her, or who were acquainted with the circumstances
in which they were written. She seldom could be
brought to speak of herself and her own painful experiences;
and at no time did she betray the slightest
disposition to thrust herself upon the public. She was
seventy-eight years old at the time, and her desire
for seclusion grew stronger as years advanced, until
her entourage became narrowed down to the simple
companionship of her immediate family circle.</p>

<p>The <cite>Memoirs</cite> came to be written in this wise:</p>

<p>Her two sons, Joseph and Francis, in collaboration
with an old literary friend of the name of Francis
Hervé, settled in their minds that the old lady should
be induced to leave behind her an account of her
career.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;" id="illus91">

<img src="images/illus91.jpg" width="380" height="525" alt="" />

<p class="caption">FRANCIS TUSSAUD</p>

<p class="captionsub">Younger son of Madame Tussaud. Born 1800, died 1873. Modeled
by his son Joseph and exhibited at the Royal Academy.</p>

</div>

<p>As she had declared her unwillingness to busy
herself with the task of compiling her autobiography&mdash;and
in certain matters we knew her to have been
immovable&mdash;they decided that the best way of accomplishing
their design would be to record the substance
of those conversations in which they rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
surmised they would have little difficulty in inducing
her to take part when in the humour.</p>

<p>In spite of the facilities these gentlemen had for
obtaining the matter used in their publication, it may
be well conjectured that they did not always find their
course run smooth, and at times they must have been
put to odd shifts and a good deal of careful strategy
when gathering what they wanted from the shrewd
old lady without arousing her suspicions.</p>

<p>For these reasons the <cite>Memoirs</cite> have failed to supply
what is best worth knowing, such as details giving
an insight to her own life&mdash;an omission which, I fear,
can never now be made entirely good. That work
is, therefore, made up of disjointed, scrappy matter,
avowedly well written, but somehow obviously strung
together for the making of a book.</p>

<p>In perusing its pages the reader thus finds himself
confronted by a mere procession of notables whom
the old lady happened to have known or to have seen in
her day, each with an encyclopædic quantum of information
tagged to his or her name that might well have
been culled from any biographical treasury. So it is she
is to be found speaking of others when her reader’s one
desire is that she should be induced to talk of herself.</p>

<p>Neither does this “Romance” claim to be a biography.
Such an undertaking would demand of us
closer and more careful study than these brief sketches
have entailed, and much diligent research. Moreover,
such has not been the purpose of these pages.</p>

<p>By those who had the best authority to speak of
her I have been often reminded of the trials and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
hardships against which she had to battle during her
long and strenuous career, showing a courage and
determination that might well have broken the spirit
of many a man. In estimating her character and her
achievements, my mind turns to events of the past few
years which have demonstrated how capable women are
of enacting a great part in the drama of human life.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud brought cheerfulness and geniality
to bear upon the tasks that lay before her, and
therein lay the secret of her triumphs. She was diligent
and attentive to her business, devoted to her
family, and attached to her friends.</p>

<p>The measure of her years far exceeded the allotted
span, and she was rewarded, despite the slightness of
her frame, with an almost unbroken continuation of
good health, until, on the 15th of April, 1850 she
passed peacefully and painlessly away at her house
attached to the Exhibition in Baker Street.</p>

<p>Forty years of her life had been chiefly spent in
Paris and the latter fifty years mostly in London;
so that her biography may be said to comprise a tale
of two cities. She was buried in the catacombs of St.
Mary’s Church, Cadogan Place, Chelsea.</p>

<p>The last words she spoke in this world were characteristic
of this wonderful woman’s indomitable spirit.
Calling her sons, Joseph and Francis, to her bedside,
she gently upbraided them for showing distress at her
departure, rather than gratitude that she had been
spared to them so long. Her farewell exhortation
was, “I divide my property equally between you, and
implore you, above all things, never to quarrel.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
